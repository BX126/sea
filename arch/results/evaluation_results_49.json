Panoramic radiograph showed a well-defined radiolucency around the impacted left third molar. The lesion and the impacted tooth were excised en bloc. \n\nGrossly, the specimen included both intraosseous and extraosseous components. Histologic examination demonstrated cords, interconnecting strands, and islands of odontogenic epithelium embedded in a cell-rich, myxoid mesenchymal stroma. The epithelial strands and cords were lined by a double layer of cuboidal cells. The islands exhibited peripheral tall columnar cells with polarized nuclei and clear, vacuolated cytoplasm surrounding central stellate reticulum-like cells. Juxtaepithelial hyalinization was noted around some islands. No hard-tissue (enamel or dentin) formation was seen. The cellularity varied, with focal hypercellular areas and other sparsely cellular, myxoid regions. A thin fibrous capsule partially surrounded the lesion.

He denied Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, dyspnea, or wheezing. His blood pressure at presentation was 100\u2013110\u2009mmHg systolic, with a serum creatinine of 0.8\u2009mg/dL. He had a history of treated hepatitis B without active disease.\n\nSerologic studies showed a negative antinuclear antibody, negative anti\u2013Smith and anti\u2013ribonucleoprotein antibodies, and low-level anti\u2013topoisomerase I (3\u20134\u2009AU/mL). Nailfold capillaroscopy was suggestive of systemic sclerosis, and a skin biopsy was read as suspicious for morphea versus systemic sclerosis. Echocardiography revealed no pulmonary hypertension or pericardial effusion. He was started on mycophenolate mofetil.\n\nAn IgG \u03bb monoclonal protein of 1.1\u2009g/dL was detected. Bone marrow biopsy showed 10% \u03bb-restricted plasma cells without high-risk cytogenetics besides 1q and 5q gains, monosomy 13, and 14q deletions. Three months after presentation, for unclear reasons, he was started on high-dose prednisone (60\u2009mg daily). Shortly thereafter, his systolic blood pressure increased to 140\u2013150\u2009mmHg and serum creatinine rose to 1.1\u2009mg/dL. He developed blurry vision; ophthalmologic examination revealed cotton-wool spots. He received two intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (1.25\u2009mg each).\n\nOne week after the injections, he was admitted with severe hypertension (systolic blood pressures 200\u2013220\u2009mmHg), a rise in serum creatinine to 1.4\u2009mg/dL, and new proteinuria (urine protein-creatinine ratio 1\u2009g/g). Renal ultrasound with Doppler showed normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of renal artery stenosis. Given the abrupt hypertension, worsening renal function, proteinuria, recent corticosteroid exposure, and intravitreal VEGF blockade, scleroderma renal crisis was suspected, and a complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy related to VEGF inhibition could not be ruled out.

She had no diabetes or hypertension. Baseline ophthalmologic evaluation before SBP-101 showed 20/20 visual acuity (VA) in both eyes, normal intraocular pressures, and normal macular structure on optical coherence tomography (OCT). After the second monthly cycle of SBP-101, her VA fell to 20/50 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed pigmentary changes in the macula, with punctate hypo- and hyperautofluorescent spots on blue-autofluorescence. OCT demonstrated ellipsoid zone disruption and hyperreflective material between the Bruch membrane and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in both eyes. SBP-101 was discontinued, and intravitreal dexamethasone was administered bilaterally without improvement. One month later, VA was 20/50 OD and 20/32 OS. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) showed normal scotopic responses and photopic amplitudes at the lower limit of normal. Serum anti-recoverin and anti-enolase autoantibodies were within normal limits. Over the next five months, VA declined to 20/5000 OD and 20/4000 OS, with photopsias and severely impaired central vision. Ultra\u2013wide-field fundus photographs revealed bilateral roundish macular areas of irregular pigment loss extending beyond the vascular arcades, with scattered dot-blot hemorrhages. Blue-autofluorescence showed central hypoautofluorescence surrounded by a ring of alternating hyper- and hypoautofluorescent dots. OCT of the macula demonstrated incomplete RPE and outer retinal atrophy with signal hypertransmission to the choroid, ellipsoid zone disruption, and perifoveal hyperreflective sub-RPE deposits; choroidal thickness was reduced. Optic nerve OCT and RNFL thickness were normal. Visual fields showed bilateral central relative scotomas (VFI 26% OD, 31% OS). ERG per ISCEV standards revealed preserved dark-adapted 0.01 cd\u00b7s/m2 and mixed rod\u2013cone responses, relatively preserved a-waves on light-adapted single flashes, but reduced amplitudes and slightly prolonged implicit times on 30 Hz flicker.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nBinswanger disease\nChronicExertionalCompartmentSyndrome\nLung adenocarcinoma\nMenetrier disease\nSBP-101 induced retinal toxicity\nSerotonin syndrome\nnon-exertional hyperthermia\nFunctional mitral regurgitation\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\nGaucher disease type 3C\nlympho plasmacytoma\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nReninoma\nMiller Fisher syndrome\njuvenile granulosa cell tumor\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nsubpleural pulmonary cysts\nacquired hemophilia\ncongenital pseudoarthrosis of the medial malleolus\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\nAcute myeloid leukemia\nRelationship disappointment stress syndrome\nToxoplasmosis\nCOVID-19 myocarditis\nBinswanger disease\nPsychogenicMovementDisorder\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nPericardialanisakiasis\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus\nChondrosarcoma\nCandidiasis\nExtraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nwound botulism\nFirst bite syndrome\nMultipleSclerosis\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nDistal defect of the humerus\nintravascular large B-cell lymphoma\nRhD alloimmunization\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nAdult onset Still's disease\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nNonurachal adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder\nTransverse myelitis\nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\nSweet syndrome\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\nmucormycosis\nPertussis\n",

On examination he was comatose with a blood pressure of 178/121 mmHg, heart rate 105 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 of 15; he required intubation and ICU admission. He had no history of epilepsy, head trauma, recreational drug use, smoking, or alcohol consumption. His medical history was notable for resistant hypertension diagnosed 20 years ago, treated with atenolol 50 mg, spironolactone 100 mg, amlodipine 10 mg, and valsartan 160 mg daily, with poor compliance, and for type II diabetes mellitus treated with a sulfonylurea. Family history was positive for hypertension but negative for renal disease or adrenal tumors. Body mass index was 31. Thyroid and visual-field examinations were normal, and there were no cushingoid or acromegaly features. Initial laboratory studies showed a potassium level of 2.6 mmol/L (normal 3.6\u20135.1), creatinine 113 \u03bcmol/L, metabolic alkalosis on blood gas analysis, urea 5.7 mmol/L, and creatine kinase 2.2 \u03bcg/L. Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrites. A chest radiograph showed no signs of heart failure. ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm. Troponin-T and BNP were within normal limits. Calcium was 2.46 mmol/L. CT of the brain showed no lesions, and MRI the next day revealed no mass-occupying lesion; EEG was normal. Repeat potassium remained low at 2.6 mmol/L; plasma aldosterone was 36.2 ng/dL (normal 2.8\u201315.8), and plasma renin was < 0.081 ng/dL (normal 0.4\u20132.3).

Neurologic examination revealed that he was alert and had no motor or sensory deficits, but he noted narrowing of the left lower visual field quadrant. Noncontrast CT of the head showed a 5-cm, well-circumscribed, high-density mass in the right parietal region without calcification. MRI demonstrated an extra-axial lesion that was iso\u2010intense on T1-weighted imaging, uniformly very low in signal on T2-weighted imaging, and showed marked enhancement after gadolinium administration. There was no diffusion restriction after correction for a T2 blackout effect. The mass was separate from the ventricles and was associated with a large anterior cyst whose contents had a signal different from cerebrospinal fluid; the cyst wall did not enhance, consistent with a peritumoral cyst, and there was surrounding edema. The tumor contacted the dura mater convexity and the falx cerebri but lacked an obvious attachment or dural tail sign. Time-resolved MR angiography (4D-TRAK) showed no tumor staining or feeding vessels, suggesting low vascularity. Routine blood tests, including tumor markers, were unremarkable.

            "reasoning": "The lesion is an extra-axial, well-circumscribed right parietal mass contacting the dura/falx with marked gadolinium enhancement and surrounding edema, favoring a meningioma-spectrum process. The uniformly very low T2 signal with high density on CT and lack of prominent tumor staining/feeding vessels suggest a densely collagenous, low-vascularity variant. The absence of diffusion restriction after correcting for T2 blackout argues against hypercellular lymphoma. There is no evidence of an extracranial primary malignancy to suggest metastasis, and the imaging is not consistent with cavernous hemangioma (typically highly vascular). These features best match sclerosing meningioma, which is characterized by abundant fibrous/sclerotic tissue causing marked T2 hypointensity and low vascularity, and may lack a classic dural tail.",

Neurologically, she was drowsy and disoriented (GCS 14/15), with impaired memory, visual hallucinations, and an unsteady gait; deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and plantar responses were flexor. Initial blood tests showed acute respiratory acidosis and mildly elevated liver enzymes; serum sodium was 135 mEq/L, BUN 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.49 mg/dL. Chest radiography revealed a slight increase in bilateral lung markings. Brain CT was normal. \n\nIn the pediatric ICU, lumbar puncture showed CSF with protein 26 mg/dL, glucose 82 mg/dL, and 5 lymphocytes/\u03bcL. Twelve hours after admission, she developed complex partial seizures with secondary generalization and was started on phenytoin and acyclovir. By day 3, seizures increased in frequency with auditory and visual hallucinations; MRI was normal. Serologies were negative for HSV I/II, CMV, and EBV IgM, but Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM was positive (3.44), and a 5-day course of azithromycin was begun. Blood and CSF cultures remained sterile. EEG showed diffuse slowing, rhythmic parietal\u2013temporal discharges, and left parietal spikes. By day 4, seizures progressed to generalized myoclonic type despite levetiracetam, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and valproate, and her consciousness declined to GCS E2V2M5. \n\nOn day 6, she developed marked polyuria: intake 1324 mL versus output 2606 mL, with signs of dehydration (decreased skin turgor, tachycardia, 0.6\u2009kg weight loss). Laboratory evaluation revealed serum sodium 112 mmol/L, serum osmolality 227 mOsm/kg, urine sodium 129 mmol/L, urine osmolality 437 mOsm/kg, and a fractional excretion of sodium of 2.76\u00d710\u207b\u00b2.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nTropheryma whipplei endocarditis\nIntestinal tuberculosis\nlorlatinib toxicity\nCeliac disease\nMycobacterium haemophilum\nJunctionalEctopicTachycardia\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\nIgG4-related disease\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nvaricella zoster virus encephalitis\nacute interstitial nephritis\nReninoma\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\nMucosal neuroma syndrome\ncerebral arterial air embolism\nNonrheumatic myocarditis\ncold agglutinin disease\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nMethemoglobinemia\nacute cerebellitis\nMetastatic melanoma\nReninoma\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nAortopulmonary artery fistula\nMicronodular thymic carcinoma with lymphoid hyperplasia\nIdiopathic carotidynia\nStarvation-induced liver enzyme elevation\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nuterine artery rupture\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\npulmonary bulla\nnon-exertional hyperthermia\nendometrioid endocervical adenocarcinoma\nChronic compartment syndrome\nGiant bullous emphysema\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nAdhesive small bowel obstruction\ngallbladder torsion\nNon-pancreatic pseudocyst\nMacrophageActivationSyndrome\nhypofibrinogenemia\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nHemorrhagic pericardial effusion from blunt chest trauma\ncruciate paralysis\ncruciate paralysis\npseudoaneurysm\n",

Intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OU. Slit-lamp examination showed nuclear sclerotic cataracts OU (2+ OD, 1+ OS) without cell or flare. Dilated fundus examination revealed 0.5+ vitreous haze OU and mild vessel attenuation OU. Spectral-domain OCT showed preserved foveal contour without sub- or intraretinal fluid. Wide-angle fluorescein angiography demonstrated mild bilateral peripheral perivascular leakage.\n\nInitial laboratory tests including liver function, basic metabolic panel, hemoglobin A1c, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, QuantiFERON, syphilis serologies, anti\u2013dsDNA, and chest radiography were within normal limits, except for a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1:80. Complete blood count showed leukocytosis (11.6 K/\u00b5L) and anemia (hemoglobin 11.6 g/dL; previously 10.2 g/dL one year earlier).\n\nMethotrexate was discontinued; the patient was started on mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg twice daily and prednisone 20 mg daily. Two months later, visual acuity remained stable (20/25 OD, 20/20 OS), but repeat fluorescein angiography showed worsening peripheral perivascular leakage.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\ncemento-ossifying fibroma\nPOEMSSyndrome\nHemorrhagic pericardial effusion from blunt chest trauma\nChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis\ncold agglutinin disease\nAbdominal migraine\nGanglioneuroma\nWilson's disease\nPachydermoperiostosis\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nPlasmablastic lymphoma\nsulfonylurea poisoning\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nHereditary spherocytosis\nParasitic leiomyoma\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis\nEsophageal rupture\ngranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nFibrous meningioma\ntoxin-induced leukoencephalopathy\nGerm cell tumor\nChondrosarcoma\nhyperinsulinaemic reactive hypoglycemia\nmiliary tuberculosis\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nossifying fibroma\nMycobacterium marinum\nrenal artery aneurysm\nhypofibrinogenemia\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nRenalArteryOcclusion\nMorphea\nHistoplasmosis\nUrticarialFixedDrugEruption\nParaganglioma\nAdamantinoma\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nRenalArteryOcclusion\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\nmicrovascular angina\nUveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\nGitelman's syndrome\nPseudotumor deltoideus\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nscurvy\ntumor-induced osteomalacia\nidiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins\nK\u00fcttner's tumor\n",

Her HIV had been well controlled on zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir for the past three years, with CD4 counts consistently >500 cells/mm3. Forty-five days before presentation her regimen was changed to zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine because of gastrointestinal intolerance. Twenty days after starting nevirapine the rash and jaundice began. \n\nOn examination: temperature 39.0\u00b0C; blood pressure 95/66 mm Hg; marked conjunctival and skin icterus; diffuse maculopapular rash covering >50% of body surface; no lymphadenopathy; abdomen soft with tenderness in the right hypochondrium; no hepatosplenomegaly; neurologic examination normal.\n\nLaboratory studies showed: normal complete blood count and differential; normal glucose, electrolytes, and pancreatic enzymes; elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase; acute kidney injury with a threefold increase in serum creatinine and a 75% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Cerebral and spinal MRI findings were unremarkable. Workup for myasthenia gravis was negative, with normal nerve conduction studies and no acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis was ruled out by short/long exercise tests and genetic analysis of SCN4A, KCNJ18, KCNJ2, and CACNA1S. He underwent a 4-week in-patient rehabilitation program and fully recovered within 6 months.\n\nSecond episode (one year later): He presented to the emergency department with a panic attack manifesting as acute hyperventilation and anxiety, accompanied by paresthesia and tetany in all four limbs. It was unclear whether the sensorimotor symptoms preceded or followed the panic attack. He reported normal physical activity and a balanced diet in the preceding months.\n\nOn examination, he had tetraparesis with muscle strength of 4/5 (Medical Research Council scale), a positive Trousseau\u2019s sign on the right hand, normal cranial nerves, no sensory deficit, and normal deep tendon and plantar reflexes. Gait and balance were not assessed in the acute setting.\n\nArterial blood gas analysis showed acute respiratory alkalosis: pH 7.57 (NR 7.35\u20137.45), PaCO\u2082 19.2 mmHg (NR 30\u201345 mmHg), PaO\u2082 105 mmHg (NR 82.5\u2013105 mmHg), HCO\u2083\u207b 17.7 mmol/L (NR 22\u201326 mmol/L), and a base excess of \u20131.3 mmol/L (NR \u00b12\u20133 mmol/L). Blood chemistry revealed severe hypophosphatemia (0.2 mmol/L) and rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase 44 913 U/L; AST 397 U/L; ALT 133 U/L). Other blood tests, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B9, B12, amino acids, and TSH, were normal. Urinalysis showed no renal phosphate loss.

Liver function tests and tumor markers (AFP, CEA) were within normal limits.  \nAbdominal ultrasonography revealed a solitary, heterogeneous, hypoechoic mass in the liver with an ill-defined margin; color Doppler imaging demonstrated abundant blood flow at the lesion\u2019s periphery. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 6.4 \u00d7 8.0 cm low-density mass in segment IV with inhomogeneous enhancement in the portal phase. MRI confirmed a lesion that was hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and showed strong heterogeneous enhancement after gadolinium administration. There was no lymphadenopathy, portal vein involvement, or other lesions.  \nGiven the hypervascular nature of the mass, its lack of adipose tissue, and absence of thick-walled vessels, the lesion was initially interpreted as a hemangioma, an atypical hepatocellular carcinoma, or a metastatic focus.

He reported right foot slap and tripping on uneven ground, later developing bilateral foot drop, exercise-related leg fatigue, and mild difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a low chair. There was no bulbar or upper-limb involvement. He also described sensory loss in both feet to mid-shin level with mild superficial dysesthesia. A prior workup suggested bilateral L5 radiculopathy, but lumbar MRI was normal.\n\nOn examination, there was no obvious muscle atrophy. Manual strength testing revealed isolated distal lower-limb weakness: ankle dorsiflexion 2/5 on the right, 4\u2013/5 on the left; inversion and eversion 4/5; plantar flexion difficulty when standing on toes. Hip girdle and thigh strength were 5/5. Pinprick and light-touch sensation were reduced in a length-dependent distribution; vibration and proprioception were intact. Reflexes were 1+ in the upper limbs and absent at the knees and ankles.\n\nLaboratory studies showed normal CBC, vitamin B12, TSH, serum protein electrophoresis, hemoglobin A1c, paraneoplastic antibodies, and renal and liver function tests. Creatine kinase was mildly elevated at 508 U/L. A 30-gene Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth panel was negative. Because EMG showed myotonic potentials, genetic testing for myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 was performed and was negative.\n\nNerve conduction studies revealed mildly reduced peroneal and tibial CMAP amplitudes with normal distal latencies and conduction velocities. Sensory nerve conduction studies were within normal limits. Needle EMG demonstrated fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and polyphasic, long-duration motor-unit potentials with reduced recruitment in the tibialis anterior (most prominent) and gastrocnemius. Prominent myotonic discharges were also noted in several muscles. The biceps brachii and vastus lateralis were normal. Overall, these findings were interpreted as consistent with a predominantly motor length-dependent polyneuropathy.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\nEnteric duplication cyst\nTuberculosis\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of the nasal type\nextrauterine adenomyoma\nSubependymoma\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\nsebaceous carcinoma\nLower oesophageal stricture\nacquired hemophilia\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\nStrumaOvarii\nHypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis\nReactive arthritis\nDrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\nadrenal hemorrhage\nsclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma\nurticaria multiforme\neosinophilic myocarditis\nIsolated arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nPituitary metastasis\nRheumatoid arthritis\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\nSchwannoma\nMultipleSclerosis\nIntermittent hydronephrosis\nepiploic appendage band\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nSubependymoma\nmidbrain infarction\nendometrioid endocervical adenocarcinoma\nPertussis\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome\nLeptospirosis\nMyofibrillar myopathy\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of the nasal type\nUnilateral absence of a pulmonary artery\nIdiopathic carotidynia\nadrenal hemorrhage\nCongenital anterolateral tibial bowing and polydactyly\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia\nposterior elbow impingement\nCongenital anterolateral tibial bowing and polydactyly\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\n",

Lumbar MRI was normal, arguing against structural radiculopathy/plexopathy. NCS show mildly reduced peroneal/tibial motor CMAP amplitudes with normal latencies and velocities and normal sensory studies, supporting a predominantly motor, axonal, length-dependent polyneuropathy. EMG shows denervation (fibrillations/positive sharp waves) and chronic reinnervation (long-duration polyphasic units with reduced recruitment) most prominent in distal leg muscles, with proximal and upper-limb muscles normal\u2014again fitting a distal motor neuropathy pattern. Among the candidates, most are unrelated systemic/oncologic/infectious conditions; the only neurologic localization option that could match lower-limb motor deficits is lumbosacral plexopathy, and the overall electrophysiology and symmetric length-dependent course is more compatible with a peripheral neuropathic process than other listed diseases.",

Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Renal ultrasonography demonstrated left hydronephrosis; all other abdominal organs appeared normal. Intravenous pyelogram showed an opacity in the left renal region exerting mass effect on the pelvi\u2010calyceal system. Contrast\u2010enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed a 9.0 \u00d7 7.5 cm solid, enhancing soft\u2010tissue mass with focal necrosis, inseparable from the medial left kidney, displacing the kidney laterally and compressing the collecting system. At exploratory laparotomy, a radical nephrectomy specimen measured 17 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 8 cm. The cut surface showed a well\u2010circumscribed, lobulated, firm, gray\u2010white mass (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 cm) in the lower pole, with a whorled appearance, focal necrosis, and myxoid degeneration, displacing the pelvis. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of interlacing fascicles and whorls of spindle cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval-to\u2010cigar\u2010shaped nuclei with moderate pleomorphism, 20\u201325 mitoses per 10 high\u2010power fields, and approximately 20% of the tumor showing hemorrhage and necrosis; no epithelial component or perinephric infiltration was identified.

On examination, she had complete bilateral horizontal gaze palsy in the horizontal plane while vertical gaze was intact aside from slightly decreased saccadic velocity. Pupils were midsize and reactive; there was no nystagmus, diplopia, or blurred vision. Mild bilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy was present. Hyperreflexia was noted in all four limbs without clonus; plantar reflexes were downgoing; muscle strength, tone, and coordination were normal. Brain MRI showed multiple hyperintense subcortical and periventricular lesions on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, and bilateral hyperintensities in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) at the level of the pons. Spinal MRI revealed two hyperintense lesions, one at C7 and another adjacent to T4. After gadolinium, the PPRF lesions did not enhance, whereas the T4 lesion enhanced.

She reported chronic vision loss in the right eye but denied headache or trauma. On examination, she was alert; oriented to person, place, and time; and disoriented to situation. Visual acuity was reduced in the right eye. Muscle strength was 4/5 in the left triceps, wrist flexors, wrist extensors, and finger flexors, and 3/5 in the left finger extensors. The left triceps reflex was absent. Sensation to pinprick and light touch was decreased in the left fourth and fifth digits. There was no dysmetria or dysdiadokokinesia. Head CT without contrast showed a 1 cm hyperdense round lesion in the suprasellar cistern.\n\nOn hospital day 2, she developed a pupil-sparing right third cranial nerve palsy, which progressed the next day to a dilated, nonreactive right pupil. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brachial plexus and spine was unrevealing. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed enhancing lesions with heterogeneous signal intensity in the suprasellar, pineal, and right periatrial regions, without evidence of acute ischemic stroke.

The clinical course includes evolving cranial neuropathy (progression from pupil-sparing to pupil-involving right third nerve palsy) and confusion, consistent with an infiltrative/neoplastic CNS process. Among the candidates, Primary central nervous system lymphoma best fits multifocal enhancing brain lesions with progressive enlargement and associated CSF inflammatory changes despite negative cytology, whereas multiple sclerosis is less consistent with masslike enlarging lesions in these regions and progressive third nerve palsy, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma is not specified as CNS-limited in the list.

Laboratory studies on day 4 revealed a white-cell count of 21.1\u00d710^9/L with 14% eosinophils. \n\nBy day 5, she developed frank bloody stools. Serial abdominal radiographs showed nonspecific bowel gas fullness without pneumatosis. An upper gastrointestinal series ruled out malrotation. Although abdominal distention resolved by day 6, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and hematochezia persisted. Family history was notable for a sister with milk-protein intolerance who developed hematochezia after milk exposure. \n\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin and cefepime) were started on day 5. On day 7, ampicillin was replaced with vancomycin after an abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate for ischemia, intussusception, and colitis; the ultrasound showed several subcentimeter hypoechoic, hypovascular liver lesions characterized as microabscesses, scattered loops of thick-walled bowel with minimal ascites, a sludge-filled gallbladder, and no biliary ductal dilatation. There was no pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, portal venous gas, or complex ascites. \n\nOn day 8, a contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed irregular hypodensities in the anterior right hepatic lobe consistent with microabscesses and demonstrated mild mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel-wall thickening of the rectosigmoid.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nlepromatous leprosy\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nacute cerebellitis\nIntestinal tuberculosis\neosinophilic colitis\nPineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nplasmablastic myeloma\nlymphangioma\nMDMA toxicity\nplasmablastic myeloma\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nmelorheostosis\ntumor-induced osteomalacia\nPineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nbiliary foreign body\nFirst bite syndrome\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\ncompartment syndrome\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\nRhD alloimmunization\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\nIgA-dominant MPGN\nNeoplastic parkinsonism\nRheumatoid nodules\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\npseudoprogression\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage\nOsteoma\nhyperinsulinaemic reactive hypoglycemia\nFusarium proliferatum\nOdontogenic cutaneous sinus tract\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nAdhesive small bowel obstruction\nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nPulmonary embolism\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nthymoma\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nSyphilis\niatrogenic aortic dissection\nGradenigo syndrome\nHemicrania continua\n",

On examination, a palpable mass was noted in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Contrast-enhanced CT showed an enlarged right kidney (20\u00d715 cm) with hydronephrosis, nodular thickening of the pelvic lining, and enlarged hilar lymph nodes; multiple renal stones were also present. The findings were suggestive of urothelial carcinoma with lymph-node metastasis. There was no history of other neoplastic disease or prior hormonal treatment. The patient underwent right nephroureterectomy; residual matted lymph nodes with aortic encasement were left in situ. \n\nOn gross examination, the kidney was cystically dilated, and the pelvicalyceal surface was almost entirely replaced by pale-tan papillary and solid nodules up to 2.5 cm in diameter, with only a thin rim of renal parenchyma remaining. The ureter was uninvolved. \n\nMicroscopically, the tumor showed complex papillary structures lined by neoplastic cells with clear cytoplasm, large round nuclei with distinct nucleoli, and frequent hobnail morphology. Papillary cores contained variable stroma with hyaline basement membrane\u2013like material, and psammoma bodies were present focally. The tumor invaded into atrophic renal parenchyma and peripelvic fat. The entire pelvicalyceal surface was lined by these clear and hobnail cells. No invasive or in situ component of conventional urothelial carcinoma or non\u2013clear cell adenocarcinoma was identified, and no benign M\u00fcllerian-type epithelium was seen. \n\nImmunohistochemical studies showed tumor-cell positivity for cytokeratin 7, HNF-1\u03b2, and PAX8, with focal CA-125 expression; stains for RCC marker antigen, CD10, uroplakin III, p63, and CK20 were negative.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nDRESS syndrome\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nhyperlipemic abdominal crisis\nClearCellAdenocarcinoma\nAtypical mastocytoma\nMembranous aplasia cutis congenita\nEosinophilic gastritis\nIron refractory iron deficiency anemia\nHistiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma\nPortosystemic shunt\nFolateDeficientOpticNeuropathy\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nMetastatic melanoma\nIntraosseous meningioma\nlichen spinulosus\nSLE myocarditis\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\nTubulocystic renal cell carcinoma\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nruptured hepatic metastases\nstiff RA syndrome\nOccupational acro-osteolysis\nepiploic appendage band\nPanton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia\nInsulinoma\nparaproteinemic keratopathy\nvaricella zoster virus encephalitis\nObesity-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nTuberculosis\nrheumatoid meningitis\nnegative pressure pulmonary hemorrhage\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nRecurrentGuillainBarreSyndrome\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nOxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia\nleft atrial thrombus\nmixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumor\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nneurolymphomatosis\nsubglottic cyst\nTuberculousPeritonitis\ncompartment syndrome\ncruciate paralysis\nSolitary fibrous tumor\nGerm cell tumor\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis\nintimal sarcoma\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\n",

He was alert and oriented. Cranial-nerve examination showed bilateral facial paralysis; pupils were 3 mm and reactive bilaterally. There was no sensory level. Muscle strength was 2/5 in all four limbs, reflexes were preserved, and plantar responses were extensor. \n\nLaboratory studies showed hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL, WBC 11,600/\u00b5L, platelets 305,000/mm3, PT 17.5 s, PTT 37.2 s, INR 1.27, ESR 23 mm/hr, negative CRP, and normal chemistry. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed 2 WBCs, 32 RBCs, protein 56 mg/dL, glucose 97 mg/dL (serum glucose 159 mg/dL), and no oligoclonal bands. Chest radiography and ECG were unremarkable.\n\nOn hospital day 2, brain MRI revealed poorly marginated T2-FLAIR hyperintense foci in the left cerebral peduncle, bilateral pons, and medulla with slight T1 hypointensity and faint contrast enhancement. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed restricted diffusion in the pons. MR spectroscopy showed elevated choline and myoinositol peaks.

He was afebrile, mildly tachycardic, and normotensive. On examination, breath sounds were decreased bilaterally and pulse oximetry showed an SpO2 of 90% on room air. Supplemental oxygen was started, and chest CT revealed a simultaneous bilateral pneumothorax that was larger on the left side. In addition, there were numerous elliptically shaped lung cysts of various sizes distributed bilaterally, predominantly in the basilar medial, basilar lateral, and subpleural regions. Bilateral chest tubes were placed, resulting in full reexpansion of both lungs with no persistent air leak after 48 hours. Radiographic findings suggested an underlying multiple cystic lung disease.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was required, and she was intubated. Initial hormonal studies were obtained, and she received hydrocortisone (stress dose), a fluid bolus, sodium bicarbonate, and measures to lower potassium. She was admitted to the neonatal ICU, tested negative for sepsis and metabolic disorders, and was discharged on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone without sodium supplementation.  \n\nAt 20 days of age, she was readmitted with recurrent vomiting, poor feeding, and lethargy, again with hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Treatment included hydrocortisone, fluid resuscitation, sodium bicarbonate, potassium\u2010lowering measures, and emergency peritoneal dialysis.  \n\nUpon transfer at 41 days, she was alert, well hydrated, with normal female genitalia and no dysmorphism. Vital signs were stable. Laboratory studies showed sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 5 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 23 mmol/L; urinalysis and urine culture were normal. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was negative for SRY, and karyotype was 46,XX. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography were normal.

The pain began as generalized cramping and later localized to the epigastrium without radiation; there were no alleviating or aggravating factors. She denied dysphagia, odynophagia, fever, chills, rashes, joint pains, recent travel, sick contacts, or antibiotic use. She had been admitted twice previously for similar symptoms; a prior CT scan showed fluid\u2010filled bowels and colonic wall thickening, and she received empirical antibiotics without improvement.\n\nOn examination, she appeared uncomfortable. Blood pressure was 146/93 mmHg, pulse 88/min, temperature 36.5 \u00b0C. The abdomen was tender, worst in the epigastrium, without rebound or distention; bowel sounds were normal, and there was no organomegaly. Other systems were unremarkable except for xanthelasmas on the eyelids.\n\nLaboratory studies showed a WBC count of 9,000/\u00b5L with 28% eosinophils (absolute count 2520/\u00b5L). Hemoglobin was 14.7 g/dL. Lipase was 2831 IU/L (previously 2415 IU/L five days earlier). Alkaline phosphatase was 391 IU/L, AST 57 U/L, ALT 54 U/L; bilirubin, kidney function, lactate, and electrolytes were normal. ESR was 10 mm/h and CRP 0.673 mg/dL. Peripheral smear demonstrated mature\u2010appearing eosinophils without atypia. HIV test was negative; IgG4 was 40 mg/dL (normal <86). Chest X-ray showed no infiltrates or adenopathy.\n\nStool PCR panel was negative for bacterial and viral pathogens; ova and parasites were negative. Review of her medications excluded drug-induced eosinophilia. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed diffuse fluid-filled loops of small and large bowel without obstruction; the pancreas appeared normal.\n\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies from the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and jejunum was performed. Histologic examination revealed eosinophilic-predominant mucosal inflammatory infiltrates in all specimens. Helicobacter pylori testing was negative. No villous abnormality, cryptitis, or crypt abscesses were identified.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nMetastatic breast carcinoma\nTransverse myelitis\nPPP syndrome\nPhlegmonous gastritis\nRecurrentGuillainBarreSyndrome\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\nMyxoma\nNiclosamide-induced maculopathy\nBalo concentric sclerosis\nxanthoma disseminatum\nSchnitzler syndrome\npseudoaneurysm\nAtypical hemolytic uremic syndrome\nMyxedema coma\nsmall cell lung cancer\nSweet syndrome\nSclerosing meningioma\nbilateral basal ganglia infarction\nSusac syndrome\nLower oesophageal stricture\nHemicrania continua\nEagle\u2019s syndrome\nMcArdle disease\nEssential thrombocytosis\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\nScrub typhus\nadrenal hemorrhage\nMahaim pathway tachycardia due to triggered activity\nKapur-Toriello syndrome\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nancient schwannoma\nMeningioma\nAcute hepatitis of unknown origin\nPrimary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease\nMorphea\nMycobacterium marinum infection\nRetinal neovascularization\nWarburg micro syndrome\nvanishing bone disease\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nFibroma\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\nleiomyosarcoma\nHelsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome\nMyxedema coma\n",

She had no dysphagia, odynophagia, dysphonia, weight loss, or appetite change. On examination, there was a smooth, nonfluctuant, non-tethered 6-mm level IV lymph node. Routine blood tests, including complete blood count, liver and renal function, were normal; carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated at 24.0 mg/L (normal <2.5 mg/L). Ultrasound of the lump showed a 6-mm level IV cervical lymph node with intranodal calcifications, loss of hilar architecture, and increased vascularity. Fine-needle aspiration cytology demonstrated clusters of atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and moderate cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cell block preparation showed cells positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and CDX2.

In 2018, he had right facial paralysis that resolved with corticosteroids; two years later, he noted numbness of the left face and neck. In February 2022, he developed persistent pain and numbness in his right hand, and by June 2022 he was unable to raise his right arm. He was initially treated with two courses of intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily for three days) and one course of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg daily), without improvement. The weakness progressed, and his right facial paralysis recurred, prompting referral in July 2022.\n\nOn examination, he had right facial paralysis and diffuse right upper limb weakness (Medical Research Council grade 0\u20131/5) with severe muscle atrophy and areflexia from C5 to T1 distributions. There was severe dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the right upper limb and mild dysesthesia in the left face and anterior neck. Vitals were normal.\n\nBlood tests showed negative vasculitis-associated immune markers, including antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and an elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor level (1,198 U/mL). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed 14 cells/\u03bcL and a normal protein level.\n\nConventional nerve conduction studies demonstrated absent compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials in the right median and ulnar nerves, with markedly reduced amplitude in the right axillary nerve; studies in the lower limbs were normal. The pattern indicated axonal degeneration involving postganglionic segments.\n\nNerve ultrasound (18 MHz) of the right median nerve at the forearm showed marked enlargement (cross-sectional area, 54 mm\u00b2) with swollen fascicles and perineurium, and a fusiform hypoechoic mass between the nerve and thickened epineurium. The right ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves also showed segmental enlargement with loss of the normal fascicular pattern. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed massive enlargement and increased vascularity of the right brachial plexus and cervical nerve roots. Subsequent MRI confirmed massive swelling of the right median nerve, nerve roots, and brachial plexus. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT demonstrated abnormal FDG uptake in these same structures, suggesting neurolymphomatosis.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nCentral-variant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nossifying fibromyxoid tumor\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\npulmonary artery intimal sarcoma\nleprosy\nEmphysematous cystitis\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nHepatic bartonellosis\nTubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome\nPFAPAsyndrome\nmelorheostosis\nTall cell carcinoma of the breast with reversed polarity\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nMultipleSclerosis\nChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\nepiploic appendage band\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis\nToxic anterior segment syndrome\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nneurolymphomatosis\nPrimary aldosteronism\nHemicrania continua\nendometrial stromal sarcoma\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nHyperplastic parathyroid gland seeding\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nuterine leiomyosarcoma\nposterior elbow impingement\nCentral-variant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nMalignant melanoma\nDiaphragmatic amyloidosis\nCorticosteroid-induced liver injury\nGastric submucosal arterial collaterals\nRhD alloimmunization\nMeropenem-induced thrombocytopenia\nstress cardiomyopathy\nMacroprolactinoma\nthyrotrophic pituitary hyperplasia\nRosaiDorfmanDisease\nRetrograde contrast reflux into the duodenum\neosinophilic myocarditis\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\nRetrograde contrast reflux into the duodenum\nReel syndrome\nnodular regenerative hyperplasia\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nnodular pulmonary amyloidosis\n",

His history included allergic rhinitis; he smoked 5\u201310 cigarettes per day and drank socially. Three months earlier, he had sexual intercourse with a commercial sex worker; he had not traveled abroad. \n\nHe denied fever, cough, sputum production, or weight loss. A local plain CT scan performed three weeks earlier showed multiple nodular shadows in the left lower lobe, and metastatic lung cancer was suspected. Contrast-enhanced thoracic CT one week later again showed multiple nodular shadows in the left lower lobe, slight enlargement of left mediastinal and bilateral axillary lymph nodes, and a small left pleural effusion; upper and lower endoscopy were normal. He was referred for further evaluation.\n\nOn arrival, temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, pulse 85/min, blood pressure 102/60 mmHg, and SpO2 99% on room air. Examination revealed several millimeter oral aphthae, numerous soft, non-tender cervical lymph nodes bilaterally, and multiple pale red, scaly, nodular erythematous patches 3\u20138 mm in size on the palms and soles. Heart and lung examinations were unremarkable.\n\nLaboratory studies showed a white blood cell count of 10,600/\u03bcL, platelet count of 621,000/\u03bcL, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase of 161 U/L, C-reactive protein of 3.13 mg/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 62 mm/h, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor of 1180 U/mL. Tests for HIV antigen/antibody, hepatitis B and C, HTLV-1 antibody, and tumor markers (CEA, SCC, CYFRA, Pro-GRP, NSE) were negative. \u03b2-D glucan, rheumatoid factor, MPO-ANCA, and PR3-ANCA were all negative.\n\nChest radiography showed blunting of the left costophrenic angle without discrete lung field opacities. Doppler ultrasonography of the neck confirmed multiple enlarged lymph nodes with preserved hila. PET-CT demonstrated high uptake in bilateral cervical, subclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, and pelvic lymph nodes but no abnormal uptake elsewhere.\n\nCervical lymph node biopsy revealed lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, enlarged germinal centers, paracortical dilation, vascular proliferation, and fibrosis. Bacterial and acid-fast bacillus smears and cultures were negative, as was PCR for Mycobacterium DNA. Immunostaining of germinal centers was negative for B-cell lymphoma, and flow cytometry and genetic studies supported reactive lymphadenopathy.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nneurolymphomatosis\nTuberculosis\nUveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\nUnilateral absence of a pulmonary artery\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nNeuroendocrine tumor\nDrug-induced myopathy\nPericardialanisakiasis\nMorphea\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nCardiac sarcoidosis\nMicronodular thymic carcinoma with lymphoid hyperplasia\ncentral diabetes insipidus\nplasmablastic myeloma\nSecondary syphilis\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\nMeasles\ncold agglutinin disease\nAdrenal insufficiency\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nCharcot spine\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nAnaplasmosis\nscleredema adultorum of Buschke\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nOccupational acro-osteolysis\nlorlatinib toxicity\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nMidventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nOvarianCancer\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nscurvy\nautosensitization reaction\ncryptogenic embolic stroke\nMirizzi syndrome\nRetrograde contrast reflux into the duodenum\nEmphysematous cystitis\nK\u00fcttner's tumor\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nWernicke encephalopathy\npronator teres syndrome\npronator teres syndrome\nmixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumor\nancient schwannoma\nVaricella zoster virus infection\ncompartment syndrome\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\n",

Repeat lymph node biopsies through 2010 demonstrated nonspecific necrotizing lymphadenitis; microbiologic and virologic studies, including HHV-6 and HHV-8, were negative. A subsequent CT scan confirmed persistent axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, bilateral inguinal enlargement, and a perianal mass. Review of prior histology noted necrotizing lymphadenitis with epithelioid and giant cells and vasculitis without lymphoproliferation.  \n\nIn January 2011, rheumatologic evaluation revealed nasal chondritis with crusted lesions, chronic conjunctivitis, violaceous purpuric areas on the extremities, ulcerative palmar and gluteal lesions, and persistent evening fevers. Examination showed mobile, nontender axillary and inguinal nodes. Nasal mucosal biopsy demonstrated acute and chronic inflammation but no vasculitis or granulomas. Laboratory studies revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated acute-phase reactants. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative, whereas IgG and IgM anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I and anticardiolipin antibodies were positive. Cytomegalovirus IgM and Epstein\u2013Barr virus IgM were detected, but antigenemia was negative and PCR non-significant.

Pelvic ultrasound shows a left ovarian cystic lesion; among the candidate diseases, the only condition that directly fits an androgen-producing ovarian source causing virilization and menstrual disturbance is a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor.

This unifies the cardiac findings with the systemic malignant progression better than a primary myocardial infarction alone or immune-checkpoint myocarditis given the concurrent new metastatic lesions.",

She had a history of hysterectomy, femoral neck fracture repair, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Her body mass index was 18.2 kg/m2; vital signs were within normal limits. On examination, there was tenderness in the left lower abdomen without peritoneal signs and no Murphy sign. Laboratory studies, including inflammatory markers, liver function tests, and biliary enzymes, were all within normal limits. \nA contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen at admission showed an enlarged gallbladder with wall thickening but no gallstones, along with prominent small-bowel gas, mild intestinal dilatation, and slight wall thickening. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed an enlarged, thick-walled gallbladder without stones. She was diagnosed with acute enterocolitis or subileus and managed conservatively with bowel rest and intravenous fluids.\nSix hours later, she developed sudden severe right upper quadrant pain and vomiting unresponsive to analgesics or antiemetics. A repeat CT scan demonstrated that the gallbladder had become more distended and thickened, had rotated approximately 180\u00b0, and had shifted toward the midline; the cystic duct was now located on the right side of the gallbladder.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nPostoperative inflammation\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nMyxoma\nWhipple\u2019s disease\nMOGHE\nK\u00fcttner's tumor\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\ngallbladder torsion\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nSertoli-Leydig cell tumor\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nLuschka duct cyst\nparaneoplastic leukemoid reaction\nbiliary foreign body\nHepatocellularcarcinomawithbiliaryandneuroendocrinedifferentiation\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\ntype II citrullinemia\nRecurrent polychondritis\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nneurosyphilis\npembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis\nCardiac sarcoidosis\nCeliac disease\nHashimotos thyroiditis\nJapanese encephalitis\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nIgG4-related focal retroperitoneal fibrosis\nPOEMSSyndrome\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\nInsulinoma\nSarcoidosis\nvildagliptin-induced interstitial pneumonia\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nAcinic cell carcinoma\nBasal cell nevus syndrome\nReactive arthritis\nCavernous hemangioma\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma\nNeuroendocrine carcinoma\nbilateral paramedian thalamic infarction\nHashimotos thyroiditis\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nstiff RA syndrome\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\n",

She was asymptomatic. On examination, there were no palpable masses in the breasts, axillae, or abdomen. Laboratory studies, including complete blood count and serum tumor markers (CEA 1.8 ng/mL, CA15-3 11.4 U/mL, BCA225 30.7 U/mL, NCC-ST-439 1.3 U/mL, soluble IL-2 receptor 322 U/mL), were all within normal limits.\n\nMammography revealed a high-density mass with clustered microcalcifications in the inferior lateral right breast. Chest CT confirmed a well-enhancing right breast mass without axillary lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology of the breast lesion yielded class V cells, consistent with malignancy.\n\nAs part of staging, abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with internal blood flow signals arising from the splenic periphery. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed a 40-mm well-circumscribed splenic lesion with less enhancement than the surrounding parenchyma in the arterial and portal phases, becoming isodense in the delayed phase. MRI of the abdomen revealed a lesion isointense to the spleen on T1- and T2-weighted images, with slow centripetal enhancement reaching parity with the spleen at 10 minutes post-contrast. PET-CT showed no significant FDG uptake in the splenic lesion.\n\nThe preoperative differential diagnoses for the splenic mass included benign vascular neoplasms (hemangioma, lymphangioma, littoral cell angioma, hamartoma, inflammatory pseudotumor), angiosarcoma, solitary splenic metastasis of breast cancer, and primary splenic lymphoma. Given the inability to establish a definitive diagnosis noninvasively, the decision was made to perform a partial mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy and a simultaneous laparoscopic splenectomy for therapeutic diagnosis.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nMalignant granular cell tumor\nCerebralSaltWasting\nlymphangitis carcinomatosa\nEwing sarcoma\nparaneoplastic leukemoid reaction\ncongenital pseudoarthrosis of the medial malleolus\nlaryngeal tuberculosis\nTubulocystic renal cell carcinoma\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\nFemale adnexal tumor of probable Wolffian origin\nRenal replacement lipomatosis\nPseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nIntracardiac metastasis\nnecrotizing autoimmune myopathy\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nDrug-induced lung injury\nsmall cell lung cancer\npseudoaneurysm\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nneurotoxoplasmosis\nCardiac myxoma\nNon-pancreatic pseudocyst\nsebaceous carcinoma\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nRhD alloimmunization\nCervical carcinoma\norofacial granulomatosis\nBurkitt lymphoma\nMyocarditis\nGranulocytic sarcoma\nsubpleural pulmonary cysts\nnodular fasciitis\ngiant cell arteritis\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\nReninoma\ntenosynovial giant cell tumor\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nSolitary fibrous tumor\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome\nNeuroendocrine carcinoma\nANCA-associated vasculitis\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nPericardialanisakiasis\nOvarian torsion\n",

She reported exertional dyspnea (NYHA class II) and fatigue. Her history was notable for lichen planus dermatitis treated with immunosuppression several years earlier and TPO antibody\u2013positive hypothyroidism on levothyroxine. One month earlier, she had mild COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR, with no hypoxemia or pulmonary involvement, which resolved with outpatient therapy. Three weeks later, she developed severe chest discomfort and shortness of breath. ECG showed ST-segment elevations in leads V2\u2013V6 and troponin-I was elevated, but coronary angiography revealed normal epicardial arteries. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal LV size, apical hypokinesia, and an EF of 35\u201340%; RV size and function were normal. Cardiac MRI showed mildly enlarged LV size (LVEF 35%), a thin and aneurysmal apex, and widespread patchy subepicardial to mid-wall fibrosis in inferolateral and septal segments with subendocardial fibrosis at the apex; the report recommended evaluation for recent viral, autoimmune, or sarcoidosis-related myocarditis.\n\nOn exam in January, blood pressure was 115/75 mmHg, heart rate 90/min, oxygen saturation 96%, and bi-basilar crackles were present. Labs showed hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, normal renal and liver function, NT-proBNP 885 pg/mL, normal thyroid tests, and elevated anti-TPO. She was started on guideline-directed heart failure therapy. A few days later, she developed worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, abdominal pain, and nausea. On admission, blood pressure was 85/60 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, mild ascites, and 2+ pitting edema. Creatinine was 1.7 mg/dL, ALT 46 U/L, AST 40 U/L, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, NT-proBNP >18,000 pg/mL, and troponin-I remained elevated. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with low-voltage QRSs, Q waves in leads I, III, aVF, and V1\u2013V6, ST elevations, and T-wave inversions. Echocardiography revealed mild LV enlargement, EF 15\u201320%, global hypokinesia, apical akinesia, mild RV enlargement with severe dysfunction (TAPSE 10 mm, RV Sm 6 cm/s), moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, a plethoric IVC (23 mm), and TR gradient 25 mmHg. She received IV milrinone and diuretics. Right heart catheterization showed a cardiac index of 1.4 L/min/m2, CVP 16 mmHg, PCWP 17 mmHg, and mixed venous O2 saturation 48%.

Metformin had been discontinued after hypoglycemia began. On admission, renal function was normal. Liver enzymes were stably elevated, with normal bilirubin, INR, and a mildly decreased albumin. During a hypoglycemic episode (glucose 33 mg/dL), laboratory evaluation showed insulin <1 \u03bcU/mL (reference 3\u201325), C-peptide <0.5 ng/mL (reference 1.1\u20134.3), \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate <1.0 mmol/L (reference <3), and random cortisol 23 \u03bcg/dL (reference morning 8\u201325). Thyroid studies showed TSH 8.3 mIU/L (reference 0.3\u20134.7) and free T4 0.80 ng/dL (reference 0.80\u20131.70), and her levothyroxine dose was increased. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was 15 ng/mL (reference 41\u2013279), and IGF-2 was 147 ng/mL (reference 180\u2013580), yielding an IGF-2:IGF-1 molar ratio of 10.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nCancer of unknown primary\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\ngiant cell arteritis\nToxic anterior segment syndrome\nPlasmablastic lymphoma\nSubependymoma\nScrub typhus\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nCardiac sarcoidosis\nRituximab-induced acute lung injury\nPertussis\nPEComa\nNonurachal adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder\nvitamin D\u2013dependent rickets type II\nReel syndrome\nMyelinOligodendrocyteGlycoproteinAntibodyAssociatedTransverseMyelitis\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nNonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nInfective endocarditis\nEctopic liver tissue\nintralobar pulmonary sequestration\nabdominal migraine\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\nRenal replacement lipomatosis\nLaugier-Hunziker syndrome\nBardet\u2010Biedl syndrome\nWarburg micro syndrome\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nmalignant catatonia\nMyopericarditis\nleft atrial thrombus\nAcute hepatitis of unknown origin\nAdultOnsetStillsDisease\nParathyroidAdenoma\nMacrophageActivationSyndrome\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nvitamin D\u2013dependent rickets type II\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nNonrheumatic myocarditis\nClear cell sarcoma\nOculomotor mononeuropathy\nhydrocephalus\n",

MRI revealed a 13 cm mass in the left posteroinferior thigh, centered in the semitendinosus muscle and extending to the biceps femoris. Fine-needle aspiration showed a heterogeneous population of ovoid to tapered spindle cells with densely eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional multinucleated cells; no lipogenic differentiation was seen. Immunohistochemistry was positive for desmin and myogenin and negative for CD68, keratin, S-100, SOX-10, HMB-45, and Melan-A. FISH for a FOXO1 13q14 rearrangement was negative. A diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma was made, and the patient received 10 weeks of vincristine/irinotecan chemotherapy per protocol ARST0531. \n\nThe tumor was then completely excised. Grossly, it was a mixed cystic and solid mass with a thin white capsule. H&E sections revealed diffuse sheets of round cells with eosinophilic rhabdomyoblastic cytoplasm and large nuclei. Throughout the tumor, a subset of cells exhibited a spectrum of cytoplasmic vacuolation, from small vacuoles to multiple vacuoles indenting the nucleus, resembling adipocytes or lipoblasts.

Initial outpatient treatment with azithromycin followed by garenoxacin yielded no improvement; she then developed muscle pain and lower-extremity edema. \n\nOn admission: temperature 39.7\u00b0C; heart rate 135 bpm; respiratory rate 26/min; oxygen saturation 91% on 1 L nasal cannula; mild respiratory failure. Abdominal examination revealed distension, tympany on percussion, and near-absent bowel sounds. Lung auscultation detected wheezing. Both proximal interphalangeal and ankle joints were swollen and tender, with lower-extremity edema. No rash was present.\n\nDespite treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin, fevers persisted above 39\u00b0C. Abdominal radiography showed marked colonic gas and upward diaphragms. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated mediastinal lymphadenopathy, dilated colon with fluid levels, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and a small pericardial effusion\u2014without mechanical obstruction. Colonoscopy confirmed no obstructing lesion. A diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction was made on hospital Day 5; nasogastric decompression and metoclopramide yielded no improvement. Clostridium difficile tests were negative, and metronidazole produced no response.\n\nOn Day 6 her respiratory status worsened (PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 ratio 177), and she was intubated for presumed ARDS. A salmon-pink, edematous erythema appeared on the trunk and extremities. Discontinuation of all potential culprit drugs failed to improve the rash.\n\nLaboratory studies: WBC 18 560/\u00b5L (89% neutrophils); AST 36 U/L; ALT 45 U/L; LDH 430 U/L; ferritin 3551.4 ng/mL; CRP 27.6 mg/dL; ESR 134 mm/h; procalcitonin 0.4 ng/mL; ANA <1:40; rheumatoid factor 29 IU/mL; C3 and C4 normal; blood cultures and viral serologies (EBV, hepatitis) negative.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nTransverse myelitis\nmeningoencephalocele\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\nExtranodal marginal zone lymphoma\nposterior elbow impingement\nLung adenocarcinoma\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\ngerminoma\ncaseous mitral annular calcification\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nGallbladderVolvulus\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\nPleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma\norganized thrombus\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nmembranous glomerulonephritis\nEarly repolarization syndrome\nIron refractory iron deficiency anemia\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\ncutaneous leishmaniasis\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis\nrenal artery aneurysm\nsclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma\nParavalvular leakage\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nAdultOnsetStillsDisease\nRasmussen's encephalitis\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nMycobacterium haemophilum\nFetus in fetu\nInsulinAutoimmuneSyndrome\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\nEndogenous Candida endophthalmitis\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nossifying fibromyxoid tumor\nEarly repolarization syndrome\nsporotrichosis\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\ncerebral arterial air embolism\nOccupational acro-osteolysis\nExtensive macular atrophy with pseudodrusen\nhypofibrinogenemia\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\ntight filum terminale\nDistal defect of the humerus\nparaduodenal pancreatitis\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nGiant tumefactive perivascular spaces\nExogenous androgen exposure\n",

CT of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the cystic left adnexal mass and demonstrated no adrenal mass or other intra-abdominal abnormalities. Initial hyperandrogenism workup revealed a free testosterone of 4.2 pg/ml (normal) but a total testosterone of 264.3 ng/dl (elevated), with DHEA-S 29.2 \u03bcg/dl, CA-125 5 U/ml, and inhibin-A 1 pg/ml all within normal limits. Three months later, the cyst was unchanged but symptoms persisted. On referral to endocrinology, repeat labs showed free testosterone 4.7 pg/ml, total testosterone 276 ng/dl, FSH 41.7 IU/L, LH 26.6 IU/L (postmenopausal range), suppressed 8 am cortisol of 1.0 \u03bcg/dl, and normal DHEA, DHEA-S, and estradiol.

Imaging shows a large, unilateral, purely cystic, nonvascular left adnexal mass that slowly enlarged over time.

After persistent symptoms, a standard tube agglutination test (STA) returned positive at 1/320, and she was started on doxycycline and rifampicin. Despite treatment, her back pain intensified, and she was referred to our emergency department.\n\nOn admission: temperature 37.8 \u00b0C; other vitals stable. Examination revealed diffuse tenderness over the thoracolumbar spine; otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL, white blood cell count 10,900/mm3 (53% neutrophils), C\u2010reactive protein 92.9 mg/L (0\u20135), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 71 mm/h, and Rose Bengal plate test negative. Chest radiograph was normal. Blood cultures were obtained.\n\nLumbar MRI was normal. Contrast\u2010enhanced thoracic MRI demonstrated bone marrow edema in T11 and T12, a hyperintense T2 signal in the corresponding disc space with intense contrast enhancement of these vertebrae, and a 2 mm rim\u2010enhancing collection consistent with epidural and anterior paravertebral abscess at T11\u2013T12. Ceftriaxone was added; neurosurgery declined surgical intervention given absence of neurologic deficits. A Brucella Coombs test on serum returned positive at >1/1280. Tuberculin skin testing was negative, and blood cultures remained sterile.\n\nOn hospital day 4, she developed fever to 39 \u00b0C, white blood cell count rose to 21,000/mm3, and CRP to 420 mg/L. Evaluation for a new infectious focus revealed a left pleural fluid collection.

Eighteen days earlier, he was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high-flow nasal cannula and bilevel positive-pressure ventilation. During a 16-day ICU stay at the referring hospital, he underwent frequent arterial blood gas sampling from both radial arteries, multiple venous blood draws, and peripheral IV placements but never had an indwelling arterial line. He reported fatigue, shortness of breath, generalized weakness, and easy bruising and bleeding. His medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol, lisinopril, sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, and therapeutic enoxaparin 90 mg subcutaneously twice daily. On admission, his temperature was 96.7\u00b0F, blood pressure 158/70 mm Hg, heart rate 104 beats/min, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 88% on 10 L nasal cannula. Examination revealed diffuse bilateral inspiratory crackles, anasarca, and mild tenderness and swelling of the right wrist and hand with bruising on the volar wrist. Radial and ulnar pulses were palpable; sensation and motor strength were intact; the right fingers felt cool. Electrolytes and renal function were normal. The admission chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nNiclosamide-induced maculopathy\ncystic lymphangioma\nEwing sarcoma\nHirayama disease\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nCancerAssociatedRetinopathy\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage\nAortopulmonary artery fistula\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\nParaganglioma\nSertoli-Leydig cell tumor\ncardioinhibitory reflex syncope\nsubglottic cyst\nleprosy\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nUterine adenosarcoma\nPericardialanisakiasis\nintimal sarcoma\nNonspecific interstitial pneumonia\nIgG4-related focal retroperitoneal fibrosis\nPfeifer-Weber-Christian disease\ndiabetic myonecrosis\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nCerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nSebaceous carcinoma\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nTINU syndrome\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nLoeys-Dietz syndrome\ntransient brachial plexus block\nTropheryma whipplei endocarditis\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\ncompartment syndrome\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nPsoriasis\nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\nchemical abscess\nmucous extravasation phenomenon\ntenosynovial giant cell tumor\nHereditary hemochromatosis\nCalyceal rupture\nHemicrania continua\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis\nGliomatosis cerebri\ncerebral granulomatosis\n",

A whole-body PET scan showed no evidence of new disease, and ophthalmologic examination was normal.\n\nHer clinical trial drug was held, but over the next month she developed intermittent diplopia, neck-extensor weakness, and worsening inability to ambulate. Repeat MRI demonstrated new contrast-enhancing lesions in the corpus callosum. Repeat CSF again showed atypical cells and an abnormal B-cell population, with persistently normal cell count and protein. The differential diagnosis included an inflammatory or autoimmune process, a drug-related process from her MPNST treatment, or a new neoplastic process. Given the deep location of the lesions, brain biopsy was initially deferred, and she received high-dose methylprednisolone for presumed autoimmune or drug-related disease.\n\nOver the next several months, her MRI findings fluctuated, and she underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy of an enhancing lesion that showed gliosis with mild\u2013moderate parenchymal and perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Genomic testing of the biopsy sample was nondiagnostic. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and a prednisone taper, but her symptoms continued to worsen.

Seven months later, he presented with fatigue and again had elevated transaminases (AST 434 U/L, ALT 1017 U/L). \n\nOn admission he was afebrile, normotensive, without jaundice or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory findings included: AST 501 U/L, ALT 1165 U/L, ALP 429 U/L, \u03b3-GTP 103 U/L, T-bil 1.0 mg/dL, albumin 4.5 g/dL, PT-INR 0.96.

Serologies remained negative for HBsAg, HCV IgG, CMV IgM, EBV IgM, antinuclear and antimitochondrial antibodies; immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT showed mild splenomegaly but unremarkable liver morphology. \n\nA transjugular liver biopsy was performed and compared with the specimen from one year earlier.

Lung auscultation was clear, and no thyroid nodules, neck masses, or cervical lymphadenopathy were palpable.\n\nLaboratory studies showed TSH 0.08 mU/L (normal 0.35\u20134.9), free T4 0.7 ng/dL (normal 0.76\u20132.24), and serum calcitonin 128 pg/mL (elevated).

Her history included mild anxiety and depression managed in outpatient psychiatry after self-harm one year earlier; she had no current psychiatric treatment. Repeat ENT examination was again normal; she declined fiberoptic endoscopy but agreed to evaluation by a speech and language pathologist (SLP).\n\nThree weeks later, SLP assessment showed normal oral sensorimotor function, an EAT-10 score of 10/40 (normal <3), and a prolonged swallowing capacity of 150 ml water in 26.9 s (normal <15 s). A video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) performed four weeks later was inconclusive: she could ingest only minute solid or semisolid pieces, and liquids were within normal limits but taken in very small sips.\n\nAt a pediatric clinic consultation, neurological, cardiac, ENT, and abdominal examinations were normal. Laboratory studies, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, blood count, thyroid function, vitamins, and celiac serology, were all within reference limits. She was referred for gastro-esophagoscopy with biopsy and psychological evaluation.

The pain began in the right knee after a long walk, was of fairly rapid onset, and was associated with swelling; within weeks, the left knee became similarly affected. The pain was localized to the knees and was continuous with intermittent exacerbations, being worse in the mornings and at rest. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provided only mild relief.\n\nTwo months after symptom onset, laboratory studies showed an ESR of 5 mm/hr, CRP of 4 mg/L, and normal ACE level; sickle-cell trait testing was negative. MRI of the right knee demonstrated a small joint effusion without synovial thickening. Synovial fluid aspiration yielded an almost acellular specimen; cultures were negative. A transient ecchymosis-like rash around the knee was attributed to warm compresses.\n\nOver the next nine months, he was admitted several times with severe knee pain but no fevers, systemic rash, or other systemic features. On initial rheumatology evaluation, his vital signs were normal. Examination revealed a small right knee effusion and pain on flexion; the knee posture was held in slight flexion but could be extended to neutral.\n\nOne month later, he reported difficulty standing and required assistance with dressing because of lower-limb weakness. Examination revealed bilateral calf and thigh hypertrophy (more pronounced in thighs). Strength was 5/5 in neck, upper limbs, abdominal, and shoulder muscles; assessment of lower limbs was limited by pain, but quadriceps strength appeared reduced. Timed rises from the floor and from lying were within normal limits. He had tight long flexors of the arms, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. Hyperpigmented patches were noted over the right knee and thigh, thought secondary to compresses.\n\nSubsequently, he experienced worsening nocturnal leg pain. Laboratory studies showed ALT 145 U/L, CK 13 126 U/L, LDH 2245 U/L, with persistently normal ESR and CRP; ANA was negative. Muscle ultrasound of the quadriceps was normal. MRI of the thigh and calf muscles revealed mildly reduced posterior-compartment muscle bulk with asymmetric edema. On fat-suppressed STIR images, there was signal hyperintensity in the right sartorius and medial gastrocnemius extending into adjacent fascia, and similar edema in other selective thigh and calf muscles.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nJapanese encephalitis\npleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nHodgkin lymphoma\nFusarium proliferatum\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nGerminoma\nSarcoidosis\nNitrofurantoin-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome\nNonspecific interstitial pneumonia\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nautosensitization reaction\nRituximab-induced acute lung injury\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nUnilateral absence of a pulmonary artery\nCerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nopioid-induced catatonia\nHerpes simplex virus 1 encephalitis\nGranular cell tumor\nHemicrania continua\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\nQFever\nUreteral stone\nEssential thrombocytosis\nlymphocytic myocarditis\nepinephrine toxicity\nStreptococcus salivarius pneumonia\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\nMethotrexate pneumonitis\nAmeloblasticFibroma\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nAbdominal migraine\nMahaim pathway tachycardia due to triggered activity\nTubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome\nnodular regenerative hyperplasia\nCancer of unknown primary\nBucillamine-induced pneumonitis\nListeria rhombencephalitis\nB-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia\nMembranous nephropathy\nsubglottic cyst\nEssential thrombocytosis\nMyocarditis\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nEosinophilic gastritis\n",

She also reported migratory pain involving her ankles, knees, and hips of the same duration; the pain worsened with activity and was not associated with morning stiffness. She had no history of sexual activity, no family history of tuberculosis or rheumatologic disease, and had received BCG vaccination at birth. \n\nOn examination, she was afebrile. There was mild swelling of the left ankle without erythema, tenderness, or limitation of movement; all other joints and the remainder of her examination were normal. Initial complete blood count and creatine phosphokinase level were normal; radiographs of the hands and knees showed no erosions. She was treated with NSAIDs and other symptomatic measures, but her pain worsened over the next week, now involving her wrists and small joints of the hands bilaterally. She failed to respond to escalated analgesic therapy, and developed low-grade fevers to 37.8 \u00b0C, anorexia, fatigue, a 2-kg weight loss, and a mild nonproductive cough. \n\nLaboratory testing revealed an ESR of 72 mm/hour and a CRP of 4.9 mg/dL. A tapering course of corticosteroids produced partial relief of pain but persistent daily fevers. Ten days after steroids were discontinued, she returned with worsening polyarthritis, fevers to 37.8 \u00b0C, an additional 2-kg weight loss, and cough. Her ESR was 70 mm/hour, CRP 5.3 mg/dL, and ferritin 204 mg/dL; ANA was positive, but ASMA, AMA, anti\u2013dsDNA, and RF were negative. Chest radiography revealed patchy right perihilar and lower-lobe infiltrates without lymphadenopathy or effusion. A PPD skin test showed 22 mm of induration at 72 hours, compared with a negative test 2 years earlier. Attempts to obtain sputum and synovial fluid for AFB were unsuccessful, and the patient declined invasive procedures.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nSerpentine-like syndrome\nMulticentric reticulohistiocytosis\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nabdominal migraine\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\nErosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp\nNiclosamide-induced maculopathy\nPosterior ischemic optic neuropathy\nLeptospirosis\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma\nRelapsing polychondritis\nGliomatosis cerebri\nleiomyosarcoma\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nbilateral basal ganglia infarction\nPhototoxic reaction\nIron refractory iron deficiency anemia\nTuberculousPeritonitis\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nReninoma\ncold agglutinin disease\ntype II citrullinemia\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\nIntestinal tuberculosis\ndecompression retinopathy\nExogenous androgen exposure\nVanishing bone disease\nautoimmune myelofibrosis\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nwound botulism\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults\nNeuroblastoma\nSerous cystadenoma\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\nLeptospirosis\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nAzathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus\nrudimentary uterine horn pregnancy\nembryonal rhabdomyosarcoma\nDrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\npsittacosis\nLeft atrial tachycardia\nPoncet\u2019s disease\ncongenital pulmonary airway malformation\nIgG4-related disease\nTuberculosis\n",

            "reasoning": "The patient developed a subacute, migratory, symmetric polyarthritis beginning in the ankles/heels and progressing to wrists and small hand joints, with minimal objective synovitis and no erosions on radiographs. Systemic inflammatory features (elevated ESR/CRP, low-grade fevers, weight loss, fatigue) emerged along with a nonproductive cough and new patchy pulmonary infiltrates. A strongly positive new PPD conversion (22 mm, previously negative 2 years prior) supports recent tuberculosis infection. The arthritis partially improved with corticosteroids but fevers persisted, consistent with an inflammatory reactive process rather than primary autoimmune disease; serologies for RF and anti-dsDNA were negative and ferritin was not markedly elevated. Together, these findings best fit a sterile reactive polyarthritis associated with active tuberculosis rather than direct septic tuberculous arthritis, making Poncet\u2019s disease the most likely diagnosis.",

His medical history was otherwise noncontributory, aside from an epileptic attack in childhood; dental history included extraction of his lower front teeth one year earlier.  \nOn examination, he had hypertelorism, a flat nasal bridge, saddle nose, mild webbing of the neck, pectus excavatum, arachnodactyly, and clubbing of the nails. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable, and electrocardiography was normal. A hand\u2013wrist radiograph showed a missing carpal bone with no fusion of the remaining carpal bones. Hematology revealed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (179 U/L).  \nIntraoral examination showed multiple submerged and retained deciduous teeth (numbers 53, 54, 55, 63, 64, 65, 73, 74, 75, 84, and 85), a deep bite, a high\u2010arched palate, gingival overgrowth with supernumerary teeth in the lower anterior region, and grade I mobility of the lower permanent incisors. Numerous permanent teeth (12, 14, 15, 22, 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, 43, 44, 45, and 46) were unerupted; all erupted teeth were caries\u2010free.  \nAn orthopantomogram revealed three supernumerary lower anterior teeth, congenitally missing teeth (12, 22, 38, and 48), multiple impacted permanent teeth, and an impacted mandibular right first permanent molar (tooth 46) with divergent roots. Cephalometric analysis demonstrated a skeletal Class I malocclusion with orthognathic maxilla and mandible, a horizontal growth pattern, and retroclined upper and lower incisors.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nNonspecific interstitial pneumonia\nurticaria multiforme\nDrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nlepromatous leprosy\nCancerAssociatedRetinopathy\nurticaria multiforme\nRetrograde contrast reflux into the duodenum\nMOGHE\nParaneoplastic morphea\ncystic lymphangioma\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nNeuromyelitisOpticaSpectrumDisorder\nthyroid adenocarcinoma\nAdenocarcinoma of the lesser omentum\nGitelman's syndrome\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nColistin neurotoxicity\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\nMeasles\ncerebral arterial air embolism\nInsulinAutoimmuneSyndrome\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nPoncet\u2019s disease\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nCancer of unknown primary\nmelorheostosis\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\nMOGHE\nPannus formation\nrenal artery aneurysm\nMembranous nephropathy\nMacroprolactinoma\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\ntorsion of a subserosal uterine leiomyoma\nVismodegib-induced diarrhea\nAcute myeloid leukemia\nMacroprolactinoma\nPolycythemia vera\ncow\u2019s milk protein allergy\nNoonan syndrome\nidiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nCystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis\nMeningioma\nhypercupremia\nTuberculousPeritonitis\nStrumaOvarii\nAnaphylaxis\n",

He had presented 6 days earlier with similar symptoms but left against medical advice. On arrival, he reported intractable nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, photophobia, anuria, and myalgia; he denied cough, fevers, chills, or night sweats. He used cocaine regularly but denied alcohol, tobacco, and intravenous drugs. He had no recent travel.\n\nVital signs: afebrile; blood pressure 177/65 mm\u2009Hg; heart rate 77/min; respiratory rate 16/min; oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Examination revealed scleral icterus, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice of the soft palate, and a supple neck. Cardiopulmonary exam showed a heaving, laterally displaced point of maximal impulse with regular rate and rhythm. Abdominal exam disclosed epigastric tenderness without guarding or rigidity, normal bowel sounds, and a negative Murphy\u2019s sign.\n\nLaboratory studies showed: \n\u2022 Lipase >3\u00d7 upper limit of normal  \n\u2022 Mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic liver injury (elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT)  \n\u2022 Thrombocytopenia  \n\u2022 Acute renal failure (creatinine 10.4 mg/dL)  \n\u2022 Elevated creatine kinase  \n\nUrinalysis revealed hematuria, pyuria, leukocyte esterase, and hyaline casts.\n\nInitial differential: hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).  \n\u2022 Peripheral-blood smear: thrombocytopenia without schistocytes.  \n\u2022 ADAMTS13 activity: normal.  \n\u2022 Stool cultures: negative for Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Salmonella.\n\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected but anti\u2013platelet factor 4 antibodies were negative. Serologic and PCR testing for CMV, EBV, and HIV were negative. Workup for glomerulonephritis and other autoimmune renal disease (ANA, anti\u2013dsDNA, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, complement levels) was unremarkable. Evaluation for chronic and autoimmune liver disease, including hepatitis panel, QuantiFERON, CMV, EBV, HIV, \u03b1\u2081-antitrypsin, and ceruloplasmin, was negative.\n\nGiven elevated lipase and epigastric pain, acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. Investigations for causes of pancreatitis included autoimmune markers (negative), urine toxicology (negative), undetectable blood ethanol level, abdominal CT (only subtle gallbladder sludge vs small stones), and MRCP (unremarkable).\n\nRight upper-quadrant ultrasound demonstrated isolated hepatofugal flow in the right portal vein suspicious for portal vein thrombosis, whereas the left portal vein had normal directional flow.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nPrimary generalized epilepsy\nCardiac angiosarcoma\ncongenital pseudoarthrosis of the medial malleolus\npulmonary artery intimal sarcoma\nCardiac myxoma\ndiabetic polyradiculopathy\nBirt-Hogg-Dub\u00e8 syndrome\nSertoli-Leydig cell tumor\nSolitary fibrous tumor\nLeptospirosis\nPhototoxic reaction\nCOVID-19 myocarditis\npostoperative granuloma\nCavernous hemangioma\nParathyroidAdenoma\nVanishing white matter disease\nGiant cell tumor of the breast\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nEsophageal rupture\nGranulocytic sarcoma\nacute renal allograft rejection\nAdenocarcinoma of the lesser omentum\nHepatic bartonellosis\nGanglioneuroma\nLarge vessel vasculitis\nBell's palsy\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\ndrug-induced bilateral acute angle closure\nInsulinoma\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\nNeuroendocrine carcinoma\nNeurocysticercosis\nMycosis fungoides\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\ngraft rejection\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\neosinophilic colitis\nToxoplasmosis\nLower oesophageal stricture\nMidventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nsubglottic cyst\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\nneural fibrolipoma\nMycobacterium kansasii\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\n",

She was leukopenic with cold-agglutinin autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Exam revealed mild hepatosplenomegaly and small mobile cervical nodes. EBV serologies indicated acute infection, with plasma EBV load 9 000\u201320 600 copies/\u03bcL. Flow cytometry showed reduced B, T, and NK cells. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and symptomatic improvement, chest radiography and CT demonstrated persistent bilateral perihilar and right middle lobe infiltrates. One month later, she was readmitted with febrile neutropenia, rash, elevated soluble IL-2, but did not meet five of eight HLH criteria. Lymphocyte proliferation studies showed poor response to PHA but normal response to pokeweed mitogen.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\nLeydig cell tumor of the ovary\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nAcute hepatitis of unknown origin\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\nTIPIC syndrome\nAnaphylaxis\nPhlegmonous gastritis\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\npostoperative granuloma\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nneurotoxoplasmosis\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nsulfonylurea poisoning\nHypereosinophilic syndrome\nFactitious Cushing syndrome\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus\nLung adenocarcinoma\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\nmidbrain infarction\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\ncaseous mitral annular calcification\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nMetastatic melanoma\nAutoimmuneHemolyticAnemia\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nParathyroidAdenoma\nTINU syndrome\nNeuroborreliosis\nEnamel hypoplasia\nUpper septal fascicular ventricular tachycardia\nAndersen\u2013Tawil syndrome\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nGerminoma\nBorderline tuberculoid leprosy\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nacute interstitial nephritis\nNeurofibroma\nneurotoxoplasmosis\nconjunctival cyst\nSegmental arterial mediolysis\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nnodular regenerative hyperplasia\nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nEndogenous Candida endophthalmitis\n",

Her past medical history included glaucoma, hip arthrosis, and cystocele repair. She was a non-smoker with no relevant exposures. Medications: boric acid and timolol eye drops. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed WBC 4860/\u03bcl, hemoglobin 133 g/l, platelets 205 000/\u03bcl, normal PT and aPTT, D-dimer 5360 ng/ml, calcium 2.35 mEq/l, albumin 4.3 U/l, potassium 4.3 mEq/l, CRP 3.4 mg/l, creatinine 0.852 mg/dl, LDH 306 UI/l, and normal liver tests. Chest radiography revealed multiple bilateral nodules. CT pulmonary angiography confirmed bilateral pulmonary emboli and multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, some calcified, the largest measuring 35 mm in the right middle lobe. She was anticoagulated with enoxaparin. Flexible bronchoscopy was normal; bronchoalveolar lavage was nondiagnostic, with no AFB on microscopy and negative cultures for bacteria, nocardia, mycobacteria, and fungus. CT-guided lung biopsy demonstrated amorphous eosinophilic material with surrounding plasma cells and no neoplastic cells. 18F-FDG PET-CT showed intense uptake in all pulmonary nodules (SUVmax 8.8) without hypermetabolic lesions elsewhere. Autoimmune serologies were negative (ANA, ANCA); ACE was normal. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal, but immunofixation revealed an isolated monoclonal kappa IgM. Bone marrow biopsy showed 3% plasma cells and 9% lymphocytes with slightly reduced cellularity.

Initial outpatient treatment provided only transient relief. Fifteen days before admission, fever recurred (to 38 \u00b0C), with marked fatigue, persistent dry cough, nausea, and non-projectile vomiting. One week before admission, she noted memory loss, bilateral hearing loss, and limb weakness; urinary incontinence developed the next day without altered consciousness. Three days before admission, dyspnea worsened, and she was transferred to the MICU after rapid progression to severe hypoxemia and lethargy, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n\nHer medical history was notable for hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine) and chronic hepatitis B (on entecavir), with normal thyroid and liver function pre-illness. She had no diabetes, head trauma, psychiatric disease, tuberculosis, or malignancy. She denied smoking, drug abuse, recent travel, tick bites, and any known contact with birds, poultry, or horses.\n\nOn MICU admission (day 1): temperature 39.0 \u00b0C; pulse 128 beats/min; respiratory rate 20 breaths/min; blood pressure 105/78 mmHg on dopamine infusion; SpO\u2082 96.4% on FiO\u2082 0.90.

Neurologic symptoms (headache, memory loss, hearing loss, limb weakness, urinary incontinence) occurred in the setting of infection but CSF shows only mildly elevated opening pressure with near-normal cell count and chemistry, arguing against primary viral encephalitis (e.g., Japanese encephalitis) or meningitis.

Among the listed candidates, psittacosis best fits an atypical pneumonia syndrome that can be severe and can have neurologic manifestations, while alternatives like pulmonary embolism (does not explain fever/inflammation and CT findings), stroke syndromes (do not explain severe pneumonia/hypoxemia), and Japanese encephalitis (would typically have more inflammatory CSF and prominent CNS findings rather than dominant bilateral pneumonia with effusions) are less supported.

Two months earlier, she had undergone transurethral resection for early bladder cancer and then began weekly intravesical BCG instillations. Eight days after the third instillation, she noted abrupt leg weakness that gradually worsened over the next three weeks until she was bedridden.\n\nHer medical history included dyslipidemia treated with rosuvastatin for over two years and treated rectal and endometrial cancers without recurrence. On readmission, vital signs were stable. Neurologic examination showed symmetric proximal weakness (modified MRC grade 2/5 in arms, 3/5 in legs), with normal reflexes and sensation; she denied myalgia or urine\u2010color changes.\n\nLaboratory tests revealed hemoglobin 6.7 g/dL, WBC 12,850/\u03bcL (89% neutrophils), AST 2,235 IU/L, ALT 1,189 IU/L, BUN 146.4 mg/dL, creatinine 5.74 mg/dL, potassium 8.0 mmol/L, and CK >13,000 IU/L. Nerve conduction studies were normal; EMG showed short\u2010duration, small\u2010amplitude motor units without spontaneous activity. Muscle MRI demonstrated diffuse T2 hyperintensity in skeletal muscles and subcutaneous fat infiltration. Biopsy of the vastus lateralis revealed variability in fiber size with splitting, type 1 fiber atrophy, mild lymphocytic infiltration, and faint sarcolemmal staining for MHC-1 and C5b\u2013C9 in non\u2010necrotic fibers.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\niatrogenic aortic dissection\nneuroendocrine carcinoma\nDisseminated tuberculosis\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nDisseminated tuberculosis\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\nConstrictive pericarditis\nIsolated arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nToxic anterior segment syndrome\nNonrheumatic myocarditis\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nscleredema adultorum of Buschke\nCOVID toes\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nMenetrier disease\nDentigerous cyst\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nUnicystic ameloblastoma\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nIgG4-related periaortitis\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nMyopericarditis\nRheumatoid arthritis\nDrug-induced myopathy\nChondrosarcoma\nCervical carcinoma\nhyperinsulinaemic reactive hypoglycemia\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nasystole\nancient schwannoma\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nGiant tumefactive perivascular spaces\nOrbital myositis\nRenalArteryOcclusion\nCOVID toes\nmalignant catatonia\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nBinswanger disease\nCardiac metastasis\nPsychogenicMovementDisorder\nStreptococcus salivarius pneumonia\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nmalignant catatonia\n",

Muscle MRI showed diffuse muscle edema, and biopsy demonstrated mild lymphocytic infiltration with sarcolemmal MHC-1 expression and C5b\u2013C9 deposition, supporting an inflammatory/toxic myopathy pattern.

ECGs during episodes demonstrated a wide\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS ~130 ms) with right bundle branch block morphology and left\u2010axis deviation. Intravenous verapamil consistently terminated the tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart.\n\nDuring electrophysiological study, catheters were placed in the high right atrium, His\u2010bundle region, right ventricular apex, and coronary sinus. Baseline conduction intervals were normal, with no evidence of dual AV nodal physiology, manifest preexcitation, or concealed accessory pathway conduction. The clinical tachycardia was reproducibly induced by right ventricular burst pacing and isoprenaline infusion. It was regular with a cycle length of 290 ms and a QRS duration of 135 ms showing right bundle branch block and left\u2010axis deviation. There was 1:1 ventriculoatrial association with earliest atrial activation near the His bundle and a negative HV interval. Atrial pacing at a cycle length much shorter than the tachycardia cycle length dissociated atrial from ventricular activity, whereas atrial overdrive pacing demonstrated progressive fusion consistent with entrainment. Based on these findings and consistent termination with overdrive RV pacing and verapamil, a diagnosis of the left posterior fascicular variant of ILVT was made.\n\nAn octapolar catheter was positioned retrogradely to map the left ventricular septum during tachycardia. Presystolic Purkinje potentials were recorded 28 ms before QRS onset in the distal third of the left posterior apical septum. Radiofrequency energy was applied to the mid\u2010apical posterior interventricular septum. Immediately during energy delivery, the wide\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS width 135 ms; cycle length 299 ms) abruptly transitioned to a regular narrow\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS width 85 ms; cycle length 281 ms) with 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction, a relatively short VA interval, and concentric atrial activation.\n\nWhat is the most likely mechanism and diagnosis of this narrow\u2010complex tachycardia?\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nintimal sarcoma\nInfective endocarditis\nMemantine overdose\nWarm autoimmune hemolytic anemia\nEosinophilic myocarditis\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\nprostatic utricle\nEosinophilic myocarditis\nneurolymphomatosis\nDistal renal tubular acidosis\nTall cell carcinoma of the breast with reversed polarity\nUpper septal fascicular ventricular tachycardia\nMDMA toxicity\ndiabetic myonecrosis\nGaucher disease type 3C\nPulmonary embolism\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nsubglottic cyst\nNeuroborreliosis\nnodular fasciitis\nurticaria multiforme\nProstate adenocarcinoma\nPPP syndrome\nuterine leiomyosarcoma\nadult-onset Still disease\nPulmonary carcinoid\ncentral serous chorioretinopathy\nRenal replacement lipomatosis\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nAmeloblasticFibroma\nmelorheostosis\nAdenosine-sensitive atrial tachycardia\nReel syndrome\nMycobacterium marinum infection\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nHeart failure\nPfeifer-Weber-Christian disease\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\nstiff RA syndrome\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nsubglottic cyst\nCentral-variant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nappendicitis\nSerous cystadenoma\nEctopic liver tissue\nSMARCA4-DTS\n",

Fine-needle biopsy showed a nonspecific mixed inflammatory infiltrate and steatohepatitis without evidence of malignancy; fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative, and she was discharged without treatment.\n\nTwo months later she presented again with worsening right upper quadrant pain and fever. Abdominal CT revealed a 4.8 \u00d7 4.7 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe suspicious for malignancy, prompting a partial right hepatectomy. Histopathology revealed florid necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with pseudotumor formation; immunohistochemical stains for mycobacteria, fungal organisms, and cytomegalovirus were negative. Her symptoms initially resolved.\n\nIn April 2009, she experienced recurrent right upper quadrant pain with low-grade fevers. An extensive evaluation\u2014including serologies for acute viral hepatitis, toxoplasmosis, HIV, Entamoeba histolytica, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp.; testing for urinary Histoplasma and Blastomyces antigens and cryptococcal antigens; and tuberculin skin testing with Quantiferon\u2014was entirely negative. A random liver biopsy showed mild steatosis and nonspecific chronic inflammation; special stains and cultures remained negative.\n\nIn July 2009, she again developed right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and fevers up to 102.4 \u00b0F. CT of the abdomen revealed multiple low-attenuation lesions in both hepatic lobes. On transfer, she was afebrile with RUQ tenderness; labs showed AST 93 IU/L, ALT 74 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 193 IU/L, and total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were negative. ANA was 1:40 and anti-mitochondrial antibody was negative. On hospital day 3 she developed a fever of 101.1 \u00b0F.

Empiric clarithromycin\u2010based and then levofloxacin\u2010based Helicobacter pylori regimens were prescribed without improvement. \n\nOn examination, she was hemodynamically stable, with conjunctival pallor and tenderness in the left upper quadrant; no lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or ascites were noted. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin 9.1\u2009g/dL, total leukocyte count and differential within normal limits, and an absolute eosinophil count of 147/mm3. A fecal occult blood test was positive. \n\nA repeat upper endoscopy demonstrated a large ulcer on the lesser curvature of the antrum.

Family history was negative for heart disease. Before discharge, transthoracic echocardiography showed moderate tricuspid regurgitation due to valvular dysplasia; all other findings were normal. She was discharged for follow-up.\n\nOn day 6 of life she was admitted with tachypnea, sweating, and failure to thrive; weight was 3.220\u2009kg. Signs of heart failure and respiratory distress were present: O2 saturation 96% on 6\u2009L/min, venous blood gas revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.03, pO2 46\u2009mmHg, pCO2 29\u2009mmHg, HCO3\u2013\u200912.3\u2009mmol/L, BE \u201319). Mechanical ventilation was initiated. On arrival: BP 70/30\u2009mmHg, HR 130\u2009bpm, diuresis preserved. Examination showed a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, weak femoral pulses, and hepatomegaly (liver palpable 3\u2009cm below costal margin).\n\nLaboratory studies: high-sensitivity troponin T 1001\u2009ng/L, CK-MB 37.4\u2009mcg/L; venous blood gas on admission pH 7.1, pO2 65\u2009mmHg, pCO2 28\u2009mmHg, lactate 14.8\u2009mmol/L. Viral studies were negative. Chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary venous congestion.\n\nECG demonstrated sinus rhythm at 133\u2009bpm, right atrial enlargement, inferior Q waves, and lateral repolarization abnormalities. TTE revealed a normal-sized left ventricle with hypokinesis of the inferior wall, dyskinesis of the septum, and mildly depressed ejection fraction; the right ventricle was enlarged with mildly impaired systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation were present. The right coronary artery origin was normal; the left coronary artery was not well visualized.\n\nSelective coronary angiography confirmed normal origin and anatomy of both coronary arteries and normal hemodynamic parameters. With mechanical ventilation and diuretics, hemodynamics improved and heart failure resolved. Within hours, the patient was weaned from ventilation; ECG normalized except for a prolonged corrected QT interval (480\u2009msec). Cardiac markers fell (high-sensitivity troponin T 163.2\u2009ng/L, CK-MB 5\u2009mcg/L).

Four laparoscopic scars were noted; the mass was not palpable. Laboratory studies, including serum CA 19-9 (\u22641.2 U/mL), CEA (0.6 ng/mL), CA-125 (9.5 U/mL), and sIL-2R (206 U/mL), were within normal limits, as were other routine tests. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a well-defined 38 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 42 mm pelvic mass with central enhancement in the early phase and peripheral enhancement in the late phase, with a feeding vessel from the second sigmoidal artery and no evidence of invasion or metastasis. T2-weighted MRI demonstrated high signal intensity at the tumor margins and low signal centrally, while T1-weighted images showed heterogeneous low signal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic, heterogeneous mass with a clear capsule and pulsatile internal blood flow. FDG PET\u2013CT showed nodular uptake in the pelvis (SUVmax 3.2) without distant lesions. Colonoscopy was unremarkable. The preoperative differential diagnosis included schwannoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma, desmoid tumor, and solitary fibrous tumor. Because it was difficult to differentiate benign from malignant, surgical resection en bloc was planned without breaching the capsule.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nVagal paraganglioma\nLipoma\nAdenosine-sensitive atrial tachycardia\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nCerebralSaltWasting\ncystic lymphangioma\nscurvy\nIgG4-related focal retroperitoneal fibrosis\nVaricella zoster virus infection\nintravenous leiomyomatosis\nPhlegmonous gastritis\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nextranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nPolycythemia vera\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nbilateral paramedian thalamic infarction\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\nPeritoneal tuberculosis\norganized thrombus\nextrauterine adenomyoma\nMicronodular thymic carcinoma with lymphoid hyperplasia\nflecainide pneumonitis\nneonatal breast enlargement\nX-linked hypophosphatemia\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nParasitic leiomyoma\nMidventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\npulmonary artery intimal sarcoma\nAtypical hemolytic uremic syndrome\nacquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia\nepinephrine toxicity\nMenetrier disease\ngerminoma\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nDistal renal tubular acidosis\nPrimary empty sella syndrome\nPhlegmonous gastritis\nIntracardiac metastasis\nAcute suppurative thyroiditis\nAdamantinoma\nadrenal hemorrhage\nmucormycosis\nDrug-induced lung injury\nPsychogenicMovementDisorder\nGiant tumefactive perivascular spaces\nLeptospirosis\nPseudotumor deltoideus\nOrbital myositis\nPseudothrombotic microangiopathy\n",

He denied saddle anesthesia or bowel/bladder incontinence. He was treated empirically for sciatica with prednisone 10 mg daily without relief. He then experienced an episode of leg weakness and was admitted for evaluation. \n\nOn examination, vital signs were stable. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy. Neurologic examination showed intact strength and sensation in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies revealed a normal complete blood count, normal serum electrolytes, and a normal serum calcium level of 8.1 mg/dL. HIV serologies were negative.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine demonstrated multiple enhancing lesions in the T11, T12, L3, and L4 vertebral bodies, right sacrum, and ilium, with retropulsion causing effacement of the lateral recesses at L3\u2013L4 and L4\u2013L5; a small epidural lesion was noted at T5 without significant cord compression. Additional osseous lesions were seen in the sternum and multiple ribs.\n\nComputed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, mild cardiomegaly, a dilated main pulmonary artery (3.6 cm), hepatomegaly (18.1 cm), splenomegaly (12.4 cm), and multiple enlarged pelvic sidewall, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. Testicular ultrasound was normal. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine immunofixation, \u03b2-hCG levels, and fecal occult blood testing were all negative.\n\nA CT-guided core biopsy of a left iliac crest lesion revealed noncaseating and necrotizing granulomas; Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver and Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stains were negative. Endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node demonstrated nonnecrotizing granulomas without malignant cells; fungal and acid-fast cultures were negative. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was 62 U/L (reference 14\u201382).\n\nOne month later, an excisional biopsy of a left inguinal lymph node again showed necrotizing and nonnecrotizing granulomatous lymphadenopathy without evidence of fungal or acid-fast organisms.

He denied any current or prior sexual activity, penile discharge, hematuria, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, or cough.  \nInitial urinalysis showed pyuria; no urine culture was performed. Urine nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) was negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. He was diagnosed with acute epididymitis and treated with ceftriaxone and doxycycline, with symptomatic improvement. Six weeks later, he had recurrent pain; scrotal ultrasound again showed epididymitis. Repeat urinalysis (no culture) and gonorrhea/chlamydia NAAT were negative, and he received a 30-day course of ciprofloxacin, which improved the pain but not the swelling.  \nFive months after the initial presentation, he returned with another recurrence. On examination, there was prominent right scrotal swelling and tenderness. Ultrasound demonstrated right epididymitis with possible necrosis, a complex hydrocele, and a focal scrotal abscess. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a complex right scrotal fluid collection, an enlarged heterogeneous prostate, an enlarged juxtaesophageal lymph node, and right apical lung nodular scarring. Although TB was considered in the differential diagnosis, a unilateral orchiectomy was performed because malignancy was also high on the differential given his age.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nGaucher disease type 3C\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nParavalvular leakage\nvanishing bone disease\nEsophageal rupture\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\ncutaneous leishmaniasis\nnon-small cell lung cancer\nPseudotail\nDistal renal tubular acidosis\nEctopic liver tissue\nbilateral acute depigmentation of iris\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nMirizzi syndrome\nIgG4-related periaortitis\nSerotonin syndrome\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nintimal sarcoma\nFirst bite syndrome\nossifying fibroma\nmeningoencephalocele\nGradenigo syndrome\nHypersensitivity myocarditis\nMalignant granular cell tumor\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\nlymphangitis carcinomatosa\ndecompression retinopathy\nBell's palsy\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\nToxoplasmosis\ngranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nTuberculosis\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\ndrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nwound botulism\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\ncysticercosis\nwound botulism\nMarginal keratitis\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\ntumor-induced osteomalacia\nLeydig cell tumor of the ovary\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\nHistiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma\nRosai-Dorfman disease\nPulmonary embolism\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\n",

Home warfarin therapy was chronic, but her INR on admission was subtherapeutic at 1.3.\n\nLaboratory studies showed hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL and brain natriuretic peptide 241 pg/mL. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment changes. Chest radiography showed mild interstitial prominence. CT scan of the chest with contrast demonstrated bilateral moderate pleural effusions and an enlarged pulmonary trunk. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and significant stenosis across the mechanical mitral valve with restricted leaflet motion; the mean mitral gradient was 23 mm Hg at a heart rate of 79 beats per minute. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed an immobile anterior leaflet and restricted posterior leaflet with a mean gradient of 22 mm Hg at 78 beats per minute, and it showed an echo-dense mass on the anterior leaflet.

His medications included lifelong clopidogrel, antihypertensives, statin therapy, and insulin.\n\nInitial ECG showed a stable borderline left bundle branch block without ischemic changes. He was admitted for intravenous diuresis. A few days later, he awoke with new right-sided visual disturbance. Vital signs were within normal limits. Neurologically, he had a right homonymous hemianopia; tone, reflexes, cranial nerves, strength, and sensation were otherwise normal. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate with no rub, gallop, or murmur; there were coarse crepitations at the lung bases and bilateral ankle pitting oedema. Abdominal and dermatologic findings were unremarkable.\n\nLaboratory studies showed hemoglobin 102 g/L, white-cell count 15.3\u00d710^9/L, and C-reactive protein 121 mg/L. Five sets of blood cultures were negative. Serologic tests for Coxiella and Bartonella were unremarkable. Coagulation studies, a prothrombotic panel (protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden), and blood film were normal.\n\nDiffusion-weighted brain MRI demonstrated a left occipital lobe infarct at the junction of the posterior and middle cerebral artery territories without hemorrhage or old infarcts. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a 10\u00d77.5 mm heterogeneous mobile echogenicity attached to the bioprosthetic aortic valve with moderate stenosis, severe paravalvular regurgitation, and leaflet degeneration; no valvular abscess was seen.

He also developed sialadenitis with markedly elevated serum IgG4 (1168 mg/dL) and minor salivary gland biopsy demonstrating >10 IgG4+ plasma cells/HPF and an IgG4+/IgG ratio ~40%, supporting a systemic IgG4-mediated fibroinflammatory process explaining the pericardial involvement. Negative ANCA/ANA and low CRP argue against other autoimmune vasculitides or inflammatory causes; TB testing is negative. Together these findings most strongly support IgG4-related disease presenting with IgG4-related constrictive pericarditis and sialadenitis.",

His baseline CD4 count was 5 cells/\u00b5L, rising to 29 cells/\u00b5L by day +21 of ART. On day +21, he noted hypogastric abdominal pain and was treated empirically for urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin, with some improvement. By day +35, the pain recurred, now associated with low-grade fevers and a dry cough; physical examination showed tachypnea (28 breaths/min) and right iliac-fossa tenderness. A complete blood count, chest radiograph, and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable. He was treated for possible atypical pneumonia with doxycycline; his respiratory symptoms improved, but abdominal pain persisted with occasional vomiting. On day +84, a repeat chest radiograph to exclude tuberculosis was unremarkable. His CD4 count had fallen to 14 cells/\u00b5L, and HIV-1 viral load was 22,000 copies/mL despite verified adherence. On day +112, abdominal ultrasound showed an appendicular mass and para-aortic lymphadenopathy; CD4 was 8 cells/\u00b5L and viral load 15,475 copies/mL. He consented to ultrasound-guided biopsy on day +140, and a second ultrasound demonstrated ileal wall thickening (6 mm) with adjacent 1 cm lymph nodes. Two lymph-node biopsy specimens showed no abnormality on histology. By day +168, abdominal pain and vomiting persisted, CD4 was 24 cells/\u00b5L, viral load 23,755 copies/mL, and he was presumed to have ART failure possibly due to malabsorption from thickened gut.

His history also included hypertension, type II diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease with Bence Jones proteinuria. On examination, he was hypoxic (78% on room air), tachypneic with accessory muscle use, and had bibasilar crackles and an irregular rhythm with a holosystolic grade III/VI apical murmur. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.31, pCO2 60\u2009mmHg, pO2 60\u2009mmHg, and bicarbonate 33\u2009mmol/L. Laboratory studies revealed creatinine 2.55\u2009mg/dL (baseline 1.2), hemoglobin 10.3\u2009g/dL, WBC 7.4\u00d710^3/\u03bcL, BNP 572\u2009pg/mL, and troponin I levels of 0.22\u20130.21\u2009ng/mL. Current free light chains were K-FLC 1379\u2009mg/dL and L-FLC 0.65\u2009mg/dL (K/L ratio 2121). A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. Echocardiography demonstrated a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 64\u2009mmHg, biatrial dilatation, normal ventricular size, and preserved ejection fraction. A ventilation\u2013perfusion scan was negative for acute or chronic pulmonary embolus. After diuresis, right heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 34/9/18\u2009mmHg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10\u2009mmHg. Despite diuresis, he developed worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring continuous noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Pulmonary function tests showed restrictive physiology (FEV1 61%, FVC 58%, FEV1/FVC 104%).

His father had renal failure and familial Mediterranean fever. Beginning at 6 months, he had recurrent fevers and an absence of sweating. At 8 months, with eruption of his first teeth, he began biting his fingers and toes and sustaining tongue and skin injuries. By age 6, he had learning difficulties, multiple bone fractures from repeated trauma, and by age 9 was reported to have Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome. At age 10, he underwent multiple hip\u2010reduction surgeries for recurrent dislocations. By age 16, he had deformed limbs, a sacral decubitus ulcer, and chronic osteomyelitis of the right elbow, both ankles, and both feet; cultures from right\u2010elbow ulcers grew methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter. At 19 years, he underwent bilateral below-knee amputations. Two months after surgery, he developed ascites. Laboratory evaluation showed uric acid 4.1 mg/dL, creatinine 0.1 mg/dL, serum albumin 1.3 g/dL, ascitic fluid albumin 0.1 g/dL, and a 24-hour urine protein excretion of 6.29 g. Six months later, he developed generalized edema and new-onset diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed multiple erythematous, ulcerating lesions throughout the colon; biopsy demonstrated severe crypt abscesses, goblet cell depletion, and lamina propria inflammation consistent with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease suggestive of Crohn\u2019s disease, and mesalamine was initiated. During the same admission, he had generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures; brain MRI and EEG were normal.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\ncerebral arterial air embolism\nMetastatic melanoma\nRenal replacement lipomatosis\nepithelioid trophoblastic tumor\ncemento-ossifying fibroma\nGCSFAortitis\nCoronaryArterySpasm\nTransverse myelitis\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nHeart failure\nKawasaki disease\nacquired hemophilia\nHypokalemic paralysis\nLymphocytic myocarditis\nExtensive macular atrophy with pseudodrusen\nGiant tumefactive perivascular spaces\narachnoid cyst\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome\nlymphangioma\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nlichen spinulosus\nuterine leiomyosarcoma\npulmonary artery vasculitis\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nscurvy\nHypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis\nflecainide pneumonitis\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nMembranous aplasia cutis congenita\nQFever\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus\nHypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nmucormycosis\ncold agglutinin disease\nCat scratch disease\nLung adenocarcinoma\nNeonatal severe hyperparathyroidism\nPseudothrombotic microangiopathy\nFactitious disorder\ncompartment syndrome\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\ndrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nthymoma\nBucillamine-induced pneumonitis\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nAcute suppurative thyroiditis\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of the nasal type\nMycosis fungoides\n",

She reported only difficulty in chewing. On examination, there was gross facial asymmetry with fullness of the cheeks and lower lip and obliteration of the mentolabial sulcus and nasolabial folds. A well-demarcated, hard, lobulated, nontender swelling measured approximately 8\u00d76\u00d75 cm over the left cheek and a diffuse hard, lobulated, nontender swelling extended from the left mandibular ramus to the right mandibular body, obliterating the inferior border. No cervical lymphadenopathy was present.\n\nIntraorally, a diffuse, hard, lobulated swelling extended from the left to the right retromolar regions, with bilateral buccal, labial, and lingual cortical expansion and intact mucosa. A provisional diagnosis of a benign fibro-osseous lesion of the mandible was made, and the differential diagnoses included fibrous dysplasia, ossifying/cementifying fibroma, and central giant cell granuloma (non-aggressive).\n\nLaboratory tests, including complete blood count, serum protein, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels, were within normal limits.\n\nPanoramic radiograph showed a well-defined mixed radiopaque and radiolucent lesion from the left ramus to the right angle of the mandible, measuring about 11\u00d77 cm, with a \u201ccotton-wool\u201d pattern of calcification, concentric growth producing a ball-like outline, and bowing\u2014but no erosion\u2014of the inferior mandibular border.

Deep tendon reflexes remained brisk except for absent Achilles reflexes bilaterally; Hoffmann sign was positive. There were no bulbar or respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn 2015, T2-weighted MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrated a slitlike syrinx (central canal dilation) extending from T3 to T9 without Chiari malformation or extramedullary compression; brain and cervical MRI were normal. EMG in 2015 revealed fibrillation potentials, fasciculations, and large\u2010amplitude, long\u2010duration motor\u2013unit potentials in both upper and lower limbs without conduction block. GM-1 and GM-2 antibody titers were negative, and routine blood and CSF studies were normal.

Output the diagnosis name EXACTLY as written.\n3) Use ONLY information in the Patient Profile. Do not assume missing facts.\n4) If multiple candidates seem plausible, choose the one with the strongest overall support (most specific matching findings + least contradictions).\n\nOutput:\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no extra text) that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"find evidence from the patient profile to support the diagnosis.\",\n  \"final_diagnosis\": \"the disease name that is most likely to be the final diagnosis\"\n}\n\nPatient Profile:\nA 35-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of mobile teeth in the lower left molar region and progressive difficulty chewing associated with pain and reduced mouth opening. She had hypothyroidism managed with medication; no history of trauma, familial bone disease, or systemic symptoms. On panoramic radiography, an initial patchy osteolysis of the left mandibular condyle was noted. Over 18 months, serial orthopantomograms demonstrated slowly progressive osteolysis extending from the condyle through the angle toward the mandibular body on the left side. Laboratory studies showed hypocalcemia (serum calcium 4.9 mg/dL), low vitamin D (52.14 nmol/L), and low intact parathyroid hormone (14.81 pg/mL). Investigations\u2014including serologies and imaging\u2014were performed to exclude rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, eosinophilic granuloma, and other systemic diseases. A whole-body PET scan revealed no additional lytic lesions. Cone-beam CT with three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed the extent of mandibular bone loss confined to the left hemi-mandible.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nthyrotrophic pituitary hyperplasia\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\ndedifferentiated liposarcoma\nRosaiDorfmanDisease\nPachydermoperiostosis\ntenosynovial giant cell tumor\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\nSclerosing meningioma\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nROHHAD\nSchwannoma\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nidiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins\nSerous cystadenoma\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\nPortosystemic shunt\nconjunctival cyst\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nosteoma cutis\nvanishing bone disease\nConstrictive pericarditis\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nGerminoma\nX-linked hypophosphatemia\nBinswanger disease\ngeneralized lymphangiomatosis\nLeiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminate\nCOVID toes\nsebaceous carcinoma\nbiliary foreign body\nacute interstitial nephritis\nMyxoma\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\nWilson's disease\nadult-onset Still disease\nCardiac myxoma\nEssential thrombocytosis\nProstate adenocarcinoma\nbilateral paramedian thalamic infarction\nSMART syndrome\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\ndedifferentiated liposarcoma\nAcute myeloid leukemia\nbilateral paramedian thalamic infarction\nCardiac amyloidosis\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\n",
