The lesion and the impacted tooth were excised en bloc. \n\nGrossly, the specimen included both intraosseous and extraosseous components. Histologic examination demonstrated cords, interconnecting strands, and islands of odontogenic epithelium embedded in a cell-rich, myxoid mesenchymal stroma. The epithelial strands and cords were lined by a double layer of cuboidal cells. The islands exhibited peripheral tall columnar cells with polarized nuclei and clear, vacuolated cytoplasm surrounding central stellate reticulum-like cells. Juxtaepithelial hyalinization was noted around some islands. No hard-tissue (enamel or dentin) formation was seen.

She had no diabetes or hypertension. Baseline ophthalmologic evaluation before SBP-101 showed 20/20 visual acuity (VA) in both eyes, normal intraocular pressures, and normal macular structure on optical coherence tomography (OCT). After the second monthly cycle of SBP-101, her VA fell to 20/50 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed pigmentary changes in the macula, with punctate hypo- and hyperautofluorescent spots on blue-autofluorescence. OCT demonstrated ellipsoid zone disruption and hyperreflective material between the Bruch membrane and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in both eyes. SBP-101 was discontinued, and intravitreal dexamethasone was administered bilaterally without improvement. One month later, VA was 20/50 OD and 20/32 OS. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) showed normal scotopic responses and photopic amplitudes at the lower limit of normal. Serum anti-recoverin and anti-enolase autoantibodies were within normal limits. Over the next five months, VA declined to 20/5000 OD and 20/4000 OS, with photopsias and severely impaired central vision. Ultra\u2013wide-field fundus photographs revealed bilateral roundish macular areas of irregular pigment loss extending beyond the vascular arcades, with scattered dot-blot hemorrhages. Blue-autofluorescence showed central hypoautofluorescence surrounded by a ring of alternating hyper- and hypoautofluorescent dots. OCT of the macula demonstrated incomplete RPE and outer retinal atrophy with signal hypertransmission to the choroid, ellipsoid zone disruption, and perifoveal hyperreflective sub-RPE deposits; choroidal thickness was reduced.

Cerebral and spinal MRI findings were unremarkable. Workup for myasthenia gravis was negative, with normal nerve conduction studies and no acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis was ruled out by short/long exercise tests and genetic analysis of SCN4A, KCNJ18, KCNJ2, and CACNA1S. He underwent a 4-week in-patient rehabilitation program and fully recovered within 6 months.\n\nSecond episode (one year later): He presented to the emergency department with a panic attack manifesting as acute hyperventilation and anxiety, accompanied by paresthesia and tetany in all four limbs. It was unclear whether the sensorimotor symptoms preceded or followed the panic attack. He reported normal physical activity and a balanced diet in the preceding months.\n\nOn examination, he had tetraparesis with muscle strength of 4/5 (Medical Research Council scale), a positive Trousseau\u2019s sign on the right hand, normal cranial nerves, no sensory deficit, and normal deep tendon and plantar reflexes. Gait and balance were not assessed in the acute setting.\n\nArterial blood gas analysis showed acute respiratory alkalosis: pH 7.57 (NR 7.35\u20137.45), PaCO\u2082 19.2 mmHg (NR 30\u201345 mmHg), PaO\u2082 105 mmHg (NR 82.5\u2013105 mmHg), HCO\u2083\u207b 17.7 mmol/L (NR 22\u201326 mmol/L), and a base excess of \u20131.3 mmol/L (NR \u00b12\u20133 mmol/L).

There was no bulbar or upper-limb involvement. He also described sensory loss in both feet to mid-shin level with mild superficial dysesthesia. A prior workup suggested bilateral L5 radiculopathy, but lumbar MRI was normal.\n\nOn examination, there was no obvious muscle atrophy. Manual strength testing revealed isolated distal lower-limb weakness: ankle dorsiflexion 2/5 on the right, 4\u2013/5 on the left; inversion and eversion 4/5; plantar flexion difficulty when standing on toes. Hip girdle and thigh strength were 5/5. Pinprick and light-touch sensation were reduced in a length-dependent distribution; vibration and proprioception were intact. Reflexes were 1+ in the upper limbs and absent at the knees and ankles.\n\nLaboratory studies showed normal CBC, vitamin B12, TSH, serum protein electrophoresis, hemoglobin A1c, paraneoplastic antibodies, and renal and liver function tests. Creatine kinase was mildly elevated at 508 U/L. A 30-gene Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth panel was negative.

Needle EMG demonstrated fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and polyphasic, long-duration motor-unit potentials with reduced recruitment in the tibialis anterior (most prominent) and gastrocnemius.

The findings were suggestive of urothelial carcinoma with lymph-node metastasis. There was no history of other neoplastic disease or prior hormonal treatment. The patient underwent right nephroureterectomy; residual matted lymph nodes with aortic encasement were left in situ. \n\nOn gross examination, the kidney was cystically dilated, and the pelvicalyceal surface was almost entirely replaced by pale-tan papillary and solid nodules up to 2.5 cm in diameter, with only a thin rim of renal parenchyma remaining. The ureter was uninvolved. \n\nMicroscopically, the tumor showed complex papillary structures lined by neoplastic cells with clear cytoplasm, large round nuclei with distinct nucleoli, and frequent hobnail morphology. Papillary cores contained variable stroma with hyaline basement membrane\u2013like material, and psammoma bodies were present focally. The tumor invaded into atrophic renal parenchyma and peripelvic fat. The entire pelvicalyceal surface was lined by these clear and hobnail cells. No invasive or in situ component of conventional urothelial carcinoma or non\u2013clear cell adenocarcinoma was identified, and no benign M\u00fcllerian-type epithelium was seen. \n\nImmunohistochemical studies showed tumor-cell positivity for cytokeratin 7, HNF-1\u03b2, and PAX8, with focal CA-125 expression; stains for RCC marker antigen, CD10, uroplakin III, p63, and CK20 were negative.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma\nClearCellAdenocarcinoma\nMyofibrillar myopathy\nadult-onset Still disease\nwound botulism\n",

Her history included recent treatment for pneumonia, progressive exertional dyspnea over 1 year without functional limitation, an asymptomatic cardiac murmur diagnosed 11 years earlier, appendectomy, hysterectomy, and a 90 pack-year smoking history.\n\nOn examination, she was afebrile, pale, and hemodynamically stable without peripheral edema. Lung auscultation was clear. Cardiac exam revealed a systolic ejection murmur best heard in the aortic area. Abdominal examination showed a flat but mildly tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds and no peritoneal signs.\n\nLaboratory tests showed creatinine 7.6 mg/dL (0.4\u20131.3), urea 191 mg/dL (10\u201350), hemoglobin 8 g/dL, hematocrit 27%, and an iron profile consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. Potassium was 5.6 mEq/L; other electrolytes and pH were normal. Urinalysis revealed hematuria and 24-hour proteinuria of 689 mg. Renal ultrasound demonstrated normal kidney size with parenchymal thickening.\n\nEchocardiography showed left atrial enlargement (47 mm), left ventricular ejection fraction 62%, septal thickness 17 mm, posterior wall thickness 14 mm, inferolateral hypokinesia, and a calcified aortic valve with severe stenosis (peak gradient 92 mmHg).\n\nShe was treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for presumed NSAID-induced acute interstitial nephritis and severe aortic stenosis but did not improve and required hemodialysis. A renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis with medullary lymphomonocytic infiltration; of five glomeruli, four were sclerotic. ANA and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA were negative; complement levels were normal. Serologies for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. p-ANCA was positive at >\u200a1\u200a/\u200a80 (nonreactive normal), and myeloperoxidase antibody was 120 U (normal <\u200a20).\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nmicroscopic polyangiitis\nSubclavian artery stenosis\npseudoaneurysm\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nFactitious disorder\n",

Immunohistochemistry was positive for desmin and myogenin and negative for CD68, keratin, S-100, SOX-10, HMB-45, and Melan-A. FISH for a FOXO1 13q14 rearrangement was negative. A diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma was made, and the patient received 10 weeks of vincristine/irinotecan chemotherapy per protocol ARST0531. \n\nThe tumor was then completely excised. Grossly, it was a mixed cystic and solid mass with a thin white capsule. H&E sections revealed diffuse sheets of round cells with eosinophilic rhabdomyoblastic cytoplasm and large nuclei.

The pain began in the right knee after a long walk, was of fairly rapid onset, and was associated with swelling; within weeks, the left knee became similarly affected. The pain was localized to the knees and was continuous with intermittent exacerbations, being worse in the mornings and at rest. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provided only mild relief.\n\nTwo months after symptom onset, laboratory studies showed an ESR of 5 mm/hr, CRP of 4 mg/L, and normal ACE level; sickle-cell trait testing was negative. MRI of the right knee demonstrated a small joint effusion without synovial thickening. Synovial fluid aspiration yielded an almost acellular specimen; cultures were negative. A transient ecchymosis-like rash around the knee was attributed to warm compresses.\n\nOver the next nine months, he was admitted several times with severe knee pain but no fevers, systemic rash, or other systemic features. On initial rheumatology evaluation, his vital signs were normal. Examination revealed a small right knee effusion and pain on flexion; the knee posture was held in slight flexion but could be extended to neutral.\n\nOne month later, he reported difficulty standing and required assistance with dressing because of lower-limb weakness. Examination revealed bilateral calf and thigh hypertrophy (more pronounced in thighs). Strength was 5/5 in neck, upper limbs, abdominal, and shoulder muscles; assessment of lower limbs was limited by pain, but quadriceps strength appeared reduced. Timed rises from the floor and from lying were within normal limits. He had tight long flexors of the arms, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. Hyperpigmented patches were noted over the right knee and thigh, thought secondary to compresses.\n\nSubsequently, he experienced worsening nocturnal leg pain. Laboratory studies showed ALT 145 U/L, CK 13 126 U/L, LDH 2245 U/L, with persistently normal ESR and CRP; ANA was negative. Muscle ultrasound of the quadriceps was normal. MRI of the thigh and calf muscles revealed mildly reduced posterior-compartment muscle bulk with asymmetric edema. On fat-suppressed STIR images, there was signal hyperintensity in the right sartorius and medial gastrocnemius extending into adjacent fascia, and similar edema in other selective thigh and calf muscles.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nDrugInducedLupusErythematosus\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\nReel syndrome\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nHypokalemic paralysis\n",

There was mild swelling of the left ankle without erythema, tenderness, or limitation of movement; all other joints and the remainder of her examination were normal. Initial complete blood count and creatine phosphokinase level were normal; radiographs of the hands and knees showed no erosions. She was treated with NSAIDs and other symptomatic measures, but her pain worsened over the next week, now involving her wrists and small joints of the hands bilaterally. She failed to respond to escalated analgesic therapy, and developed low-grade fevers to 37.8 \u00b0C, anorexia, fatigue, a 2-kg weight loss, and a mild nonproductive cough. \n\nLaboratory testing revealed an ESR of 72 mm/hour and a CRP of 4.9 mg/dL.

Intravenous verapamil consistently terminated the tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart.\n\nDuring electrophysiological study, catheters were placed in the high right atrium, His\u2010bundle region, right ventricular apex, and coronary sinus. Baseline conduction intervals were normal, with no evidence of dual AV nodal physiology, manifest preexcitation, or concealed accessory pathway conduction. The clinical tachycardia was reproducibly induced by right ventricular burst pacing and isoprenaline infusion. It was regular with a cycle length of 290 ms and a QRS duration of 135 ms showing right bundle branch block and left\u2010axis deviation. There was 1:1 ventriculoatrial association with earliest atrial activation near the His bundle and a negative HV interval. Atrial pacing at a cycle length much shorter than the tachycardia cycle length dissociated atrial from ventricular activity, whereas atrial overdrive pacing demonstrated progressive fusion consistent with entrainment. Based on these findings and consistent termination with overdrive RV pacing and verapamil, a diagnosis of the left posterior fascicular variant of ILVT was made.\n\nAn octapolar catheter was positioned retrogradely to map the left ventricular septum during tachycardia. Presystolic Purkinje potentials were recorded 28 ms before QRS onset in the distal third of the left posterior apical septum. Radiofrequency energy was applied to the mid\u2010apical posterior interventricular septum. Immediately during energy delivery, the wide\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS width 135 ms; cycle length 299 ms) abruptly transitioned to a regular narrow\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS width 85 ms; cycle length 281 ms) with 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction, a relatively short VA interval, and concentric atrial activation.\n\nWhat is the most likely mechanism and diagnosis of this narrow\u2010complex tachycardia?\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nNoonan syndrome\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\nRecurrent polychondritis\nUpper septal fascicular ventricular tachycardia\nListeria rhombencephalitis\n",

Six weeks later, he had recurrent pain; scrotal ultrasound again showed epididymitis. Repeat urinalysis (no culture) and gonorrhea/chlamydia NAAT were negative, and he received a 30-day course of ciprofloxacin, which improved the pain but not the swelling.  \nFive months after the initial presentation, he returned with another recurrence. On examination, there was prominent right scrotal swelling and tenderness. Ultrasound demonstrated right epididymitis with possible necrosis, a complex hydrocele, and a focal scrotal abscess. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a complex right scrotal fluid collection, an enlarged heterogeneous prostate, an enlarged juxtaesophageal lymph node, and right apical lung nodular scarring. Although TB was considered in the differential diagnosis, a unilateral orchiectomy was performed because malignancy was also high on the differential given his age.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nacquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\nTuberculosis\n",

At age 10, he underwent multiple hip\u2010reduction surgeries for recurrent dislocations. By age 16, he had deformed limbs, a sacral decubitus ulcer, and chronic osteomyelitis of the right elbow, both ankles, and both feet; cultures from right\u2010elbow ulcers grew methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter. At 19 years, he underwent bilateral below-knee amputations. Two months after surgery, he developed ascites. Laboratory evaluation showed uric acid 4.1 mg/dL, creatinine 0.1 mg/dL, serum albumin 1.3 g/dL, ascitic fluid albumin 0.1 g/dL, and a 24-hour urine protein excretion of 6.29 g. Six months later, he developed generalized edema and new-onset diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed multiple erythematous, ulcerating lesions throughout the colon; biopsy demonstrated severe crypt abscesses, goblet cell depletion, and lamina propria inflammation consistent with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease suggestive of Crohn\u2019s disease, and mesalamine was initiated.

He had undergone a cadaveric renal transplant six years earlier and was maintained on cyclosporine, mycophenolic acid, and prednisone. He wore a prosthetic right lower limb after a below\u2010knee amputation; the eruption began distally on his residual limb and spread proximally. Empiric antifungal cream was ineffective, and topical corticosteroid worsened the lesions. He had traveled to Thailand, Vietnam, and Panama. \n\nOn examination, there were multiple erythematous papules and plaques, some coalescing into an annular pattern on the right thigh. A punch biopsy showed dermal nonnecrotizing tuberculoid granulomas with lymphocytes and rare neutrophils. Acid\u2010fast staining revealed rare acid\u2010fast bacilli and demonstrated granulomatous involvement of a peripheral nerve bundle. Period acid\u2010Schiff stain was negative for fungal elements.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nMycobacterium haemophilum\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nacute interstitial nephritis\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\nsarcoidosis\n",

Biopsy shows dermal nonnecrotizing tuberculoid granulomas and, critically, rare acid-fast bacilli with granulomatous involvement of a peripheral nerve bundle, supporting a mycobacterial infection rather than sarcoidosis.

On initial examination, he had generalized edema and a grade III\u2013IV holosystolic murmur. Chest radiographs and echocardiography revealed a moderate-to-large patent ductus arteriosus, moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension, and biventricular hypertrophy suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; a bedside PDA ligation was performed. Subsequent evaluation showed Coxsackie B viremia by PCR, and TORCH serologies were negative. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, loop diuretics, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, and dopamine for presumed viral cardiomyopathy. Despite therapy, daily chest radiographs demonstrated progressive nonspecific calcification of the chest soft tissues and the vessels of both arms, and his condition worsened.

She had hypothyroidism managed with medication; no history of trauma, familial bone disease, or systemic symptoms. On panoramic radiography, an initial patchy osteolysis of the left mandibular condyle was noted. Over 18 months, serial orthopantomograms demonstrated slowly progressive osteolysis extending from the condyle through the angle toward the mandibular body on the left side. Laboratory studies showed hypocalcemia (serum calcium 4.9 mg/dL), low vitamin D (52.14 nmol/L), and low intact parathyroid hormone (14.81 pg/mL). Investigations\u2014including serologies and imaging\u2014were performed to exclude rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, eosinophilic granuloma, and other systemic diseases. A whole-body PET scan revealed no additional lytic lesions. Cone-beam CT with three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed the extent of mandibular bone loss confined to the left hemi-mandible.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nvanishing bone disease\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\ntenosynovial giant cell tumor\nAcute hepatitis of unknown origin\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\n",
