Intraoral examination revealed a 3\u00d74 cm exophytic mass extending from the left mandibular second molar to the retromolar pad, buccally into the vestibule and inferiorly to the floor of the mouth. Panoramic radiograph showed a well-defined radiolucency around the impacted left third molar. The lesion and the impacted tooth were excised en bloc. \n\nGrossly, the specimen included both intraosseous and extraosseous components. Histologic examination demonstrated cords, interconnecting strands, and islands of odontogenic epithelium embedded in a cell-rich, myxoid mesenchymal stroma. The epithelial strands and cords were lined by a double layer of cuboidal cells. The islands exhibited peripheral tall columnar cells with polarized nuclei and clear, vacuolated cytoplasm surrounding central stellate reticulum-like cells. Juxtaepithelial hyalinization was noted around some islands. No hard-tissue (enamel or dentin) formation was seen.

After the second monthly cycle of SBP-101, her VA fell to 20/50 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed pigmentary changes in the macula, with punctate hypo- and hyperautofluorescent spots on blue-autofluorescence. OCT demonstrated ellipsoid zone disruption and hyperreflective material between the Bruch membrane and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in both eyes. SBP-101 was discontinued, and intravitreal dexamethasone was administered bilaterally without improvement. One month later, VA was 20/50 OD and 20/32 OS.

Neurologic examination revealed that he was alert and had no motor or sensory deficits, but he noted narrowing of the left lower visual field quadrant. Noncontrast CT of the head showed a 5-cm, well-circumscribed, high-density mass in the right parietal region without calcification. MRI demonstrated an extra-axial lesion that was iso\u2010intense on T1-weighted imaging, uniformly very low in signal on T2-weighted imaging, and showed marked enhancement after gadolinium administration. There was no diffusion restriction after correction for a T2 blackout effect. The mass was separate from the ventricles and was associated with a large anterior cyst whose contents had a signal different from cerebrospinal fluid; the cyst wall did not enhance, consistent with a peritumoral cyst, and there was surrounding edema. The tumor contacted the dura mater convexity and the falx cerebri but lacked an obvious attachment or dural tail sign.

There was no bulbar or upper-limb involvement. He also described sensory loss in both feet to mid-shin level with mild superficial dysesthesia. A prior workup suggested bilateral L5 radiculopathy, but lumbar MRI was normal.\n\nOn examination, there was no obvious muscle atrophy.

Hip girdle and thigh strength were 5/5. Pinprick and light-touch sensation were reduced in a length-dependent distribution; vibration and proprioception were intact. Reflexes were 1+ in the upper limbs and absent at the knees and ankles.\n\nLaboratory studies showed normal CBC, vitamin B12, TSH, serum protein electrophoresis, hemoglobin A1c, paraneoplastic antibodies, and renal and liver function tests. Creatine kinase was mildly elevated at 508 U/L. A 30-gene Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth panel was negative.

Sensory nerve conduction studies were within normal limits. Needle EMG demonstrated fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and polyphasic, long-duration motor-unit potentials with reduced recruitment in the tibialis anterior (most prominent) and gastrocnemius.

In 2018, he had right facial paralysis that resolved with corticosteroids; two years later, he noted numbness of the left face and neck. In February 2022, he developed persistent pain and numbness in his right hand, and by June 2022 he was unable to raise his right arm. He was initially treated with two courses of intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily for three days) and one course of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg daily), without improvement. The weakness progressed, and his right facial paralysis recurred, prompting referral in July 2022.\n\nOn examination, he had right facial paralysis and diffuse right upper limb weakness (Medical Research Council grade 0\u20131/5) with severe muscle atrophy and areflexia from C5 to T1 distributions. There was severe dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the right upper limb and mild dysesthesia in the left face and anterior neck.

The pattern indicated axonal degeneration involving postganglionic segments.\n\nNerve ultrasound (18 MHz) of the right median nerve at the forearm showed marked enlargement (cross-sectional area, 54 mm\u00b2) with swollen fascicles and perineurium, and a fusiform hypoechoic mass between the nerve and thickened epineurium. The right ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves also showed segmental enlargement with loss of the normal fascicular pattern. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed massive enlargement and increased vascularity of the right brachial plexus and cervical nerve roots.

Chest CT confirmed a well-enhancing right breast mass without axillary lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology of the breast lesion yielded class V cells, consistent with malignancy.\n\nAs part of staging, abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with internal blood flow signals arising from the splenic periphery.

Fine-needle aspiration showed a heterogeneous population of ovoid to tapered spindle cells with densely eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional multinucleated cells; no lipogenic differentiation was seen.

A diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma was made, and the patient received 10 weeks of vincristine/irinotecan chemotherapy per protocol ARST0531. \n\nThe tumor was then completely excised. Grossly, it was a mixed cystic and solid mass with a thin white capsule. H&E sections revealed diffuse sheets of round cells with eosinophilic rhabdomyoblastic cytoplasm and large nuclei. Throughout the tumor, a subset of cells exhibited a spectrum of cytoplasmic vacuolation, from small vacuoles to multiple vacuoles indenting the nucleus, resembling adipocytes or lipoblasts. These vacuolated cells were positive for adipophilin, Oil Red O, and S-100 protein; the vacuoles were negative with periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain, with or without diastase.

A barium swallow study the next day was normal.\n\nTwo weeks later, her dysphagia persisted. She was limited to soft foods and liquids, with no weight loss or reflux. She described three choking episodes in the month before her first visit and anxiety about solids lodging in her throat. She denied additional trauma. Her history included mild anxiety and depression managed in outpatient psychiatry after self-harm one year earlier; she had no current psychiatric treatment. Repeat ENT examination was again normal; she declined fiberoptic endoscopy but agreed to evaluation by a speech and language pathologist (SLP).\n\nThree weeks later, SLP assessment showed normal oral sensorimotor function, an EAT-10 score of 10/40 (normal <3), and a prolonged swallowing capacity of 150 ml water in 26.9 s (normal <15 s). A video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) performed four weeks later was inconclusive: she could ingest only minute solid or semisolid pieces, and liquids were within normal limits but taken in very small sips.\n\nAt a pediatric clinic consultation, neurological, cardiac, ENT, and abdominal examinations were normal.

The pain began in the right knee after a long walk, was of fairly rapid onset, and was associated with swelling; within weeks, the left knee became similarly affected. The pain was localized to the knees and was continuous with intermittent exacerbations, being worse in the mornings and at rest. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provided only mild relief.\n\nTwo months after symptom onset, laboratory studies showed an ESR of 5 mm/hr, CRP of 4 mg/L, and normal ACE level; sickle-cell trait testing was negative. MRI of the right knee demonstrated a small joint effusion without synovial thickening. Synovial fluid aspiration yielded an almost acellular specimen; cultures were negative. A transient ecchymosis-like rash around the knee was attributed to warm compresses.\n\nOver the next nine months, he was admitted several times with severe knee pain but no fevers, systemic rash, or other systemic features. On initial rheumatology evaluation, his vital signs were normal. Examination revealed a small right knee effusion and pain on flexion; the knee posture was held in slight flexion but could be extended to neutral.\n\nOne month later, he reported difficulty standing and required assistance with dressing because of lower-limb weakness. Examination revealed bilateral calf and thigh hypertrophy (more pronounced in thighs). Strength was 5/5 in neck, upper limbs, abdominal, and shoulder muscles; assessment of lower limbs was limited by pain, but quadriceps strength appeared reduced. Timed rises from the floor and from lying were within normal limits. He had tight long flexors of the arms, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. Hyperpigmented patches were noted over the right knee and thigh, thought secondary to compresses.\n\nSubsequently, he experienced worsening nocturnal leg pain. Laboratory studies showed ALT 145 U/L, CK 13 126 U/L, LDH 2245 U/L, with persistently normal ESR and CRP; ANA was negative. Muscle ultrasound of the quadriceps was normal. MRI of the thigh and calf muscles revealed mildly reduced posterior-compartment muscle bulk with asymmetric edema. On fat-suppressed STIR images, there was signal hyperintensity in the right sartorius and medial gastrocnemius extending into adjacent fascia, and similar edema in other selective thigh and calf muscles.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nKnobloch syndrome\nMycobacterium bovis\nUrticarialFixedDrugEruption\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis\nLipidKeratopathy\nlepromatous leprosy\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nEmphysematous cystitis\nGliomatosis cerebri\n",

She had no history of sexual activity, no family history of tuberculosis or rheumatologic disease, and had received BCG vaccination at birth. \n\nOn examination, she was afebrile. There was mild swelling of the left ankle without erythema, tenderness, or limitation of movement; all other joints and the remainder of her examination were normal. Initial complete blood count and creatine phosphokinase level were normal; radiographs of the hands and knees showed no erosions. She was treated with NSAIDs and other symptomatic measures, but her pain worsened over the next week, now involving her wrists and small joints of the hands bilaterally. She failed to respond to escalated analgesic therapy, and developed low-grade fevers to 37.8 \u00b0C, anorexia, fatigue, a 2-kg weight loss, and a mild nonproductive cough. \n\nLaboratory testing revealed an ESR of 72 mm/hour and a CRP of 4.9 mg/dL. A tapering course of corticosteroids produced partial relief of pain but persistent daily fevers. Ten days after steroids were discontinued, she returned with worsening polyarthritis, fevers to 37.8 \u00b0C, an additional 2-kg weight loss, and cough. Her ESR was 70 mm/hour, CRP 5.3 mg/dL, and ferritin 204 mg/dL; ANA was positive, but ASMA, AMA, anti\u2013dsDNA, and RF were negative. Chest radiography revealed patchy right perihilar and lower-lobe infiltrates without lymphadenopathy or effusion.

Intravenous verapamil consistently terminated the tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart.\n\nDuring electrophysiological study, catheters were placed in the high right atrium, His\u2010bundle region, right ventricular apex, and coronary sinus. Baseline conduction intervals were normal, with no evidence of dual AV nodal physiology, manifest preexcitation, or concealed accessory pathway conduction. The clinical tachycardia was reproducibly induced by right ventricular burst pacing and isoprenaline infusion. It was regular with a cycle length of 290 ms and a QRS duration of 135 ms showing right bundle branch block and left\u2010axis deviation. There was 1:1 ventriculoatrial association with earliest atrial activation near the His bundle and a negative HV interval. Atrial pacing at a cycle length much shorter than the tachycardia cycle length dissociated atrial from ventricular activity, whereas atrial overdrive pacing demonstrated progressive fusion consistent with entrainment. Based on these findings and consistent termination with overdrive RV pacing and verapamil, a diagnosis of the left posterior fascicular variant of ILVT was made.\n\nAn octapolar catheter was positioned retrogradely to map the left ventricular septum during tachycardia. Presystolic Purkinje potentials were recorded 28 ms before QRS onset in the distal third of the left posterior apical septum. Radiofrequency energy was applied to the mid\u2010apical posterior interventricular septum. Immediately during energy delivery, the wide\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS width 135 ms; cycle length 299 ms) abruptly transitioned to a regular narrow\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS width 85 ms; cycle length 281 ms) with 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction, a relatively short VA interval, and concentric atrial activation.\n\nWhat is the most likely mechanism and diagnosis of this narrow\u2010complex tachycardia?\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nNevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome\nEndogenous Candida endophthalmitis\nIntussusception\nidiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nUpper septal fascicular ventricular tachycardia\nLaugier\u2013Hunziker syndrome\nneurogenic pulmonary edema\nvanishing bone disease\n",

He denied saddle anesthesia or bowel/bladder incontinence. He was treated empirically for sciatica with prednisone 10 mg daily without relief. He then experienced an episode of leg weakness and was admitted for evaluation. \n\nOn examination, vital signs were stable. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy. Neurologic examination showed intact strength and sensation in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies revealed a normal complete blood count, normal serum electrolytes, and a normal serum calcium level of 8.1 mg/dL. HIV serologies were negative.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine demonstrated multiple enhancing lesions in the T11, T12, L3, and L4 vertebral bodies, right sacrum, and ilium, with retropulsion causing effacement of the lateral recesses at L3\u2013L4 and L4\u2013L5; a small epidural lesion was noted at T5 without significant cord compression. Additional osseous lesions were seen in the sternum and multiple ribs.\n\nComputed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, mild cardiomegaly, a dilated main pulmonary artery (3.6 cm), hepatomegaly (18.1 cm), splenomegaly (12.4 cm), and multiple enlarged pelvic sidewall, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. Testicular ultrasound was normal. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine immunofixation, \u03b2-hCG levels, and fecal occult blood testing were all negative.\n\nA CT-guided core biopsy of a left iliac crest lesion revealed noncaseating and necrotizing granulomas; Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver and Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stains were negative. Endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node demonstrated nonnecrotizing granulomas without malignant cells; fungal and acid-fast cultures were negative.

At 8 months, with eruption of his first teeth, he began biting his fingers and toes and sustaining tongue and skin injuries. By age 6, he had learning difficulties, multiple bone fractures from repeated trauma, and by age 9 was reported to have Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome. At age 10, he underwent multiple hip\u2010reduction surgeries for recurrent dislocations. By age 16, he had deformed limbs, a sacral decubitus ulcer, and chronic osteomyelitis of the right elbow, both ankles, and both feet; cultures from right\u2010elbow ulcers grew methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter. At 19 years, he underwent bilateral below-knee amputations. Two months after surgery, he developed ascites. Laboratory evaluation showed uric acid 4.1 mg/dL, creatinine 0.1 mg/dL, serum albumin 1.3 g/dL, ascitic fluid albumin 0.1 g/dL, and a 24-hour urine protein excretion of 6.29 g.

Output the diagnosis name EXACTLY as written.\n3) Use ONLY information in the Patient Profile. Do not assume missing facts.\n4) If multiple candidates seem plausible, choose the one with the strongest overall support (most specific matching findings + least contradictions).\n\nOutput:\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no extra text) that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"find evidence from the patient profile to support the diagnosis.\",\n  \"final_diagnosis\": \"the disease name that is most likely to be the final diagnosis\"\n}\n\nPatient Profile:\nA 35-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of mobile teeth in the lower left molar region and progressive difficulty chewing associated with pain and reduced mouth opening. She had hypothyroidism managed with medication; no history of trauma, familial bone disease, or systemic symptoms. On panoramic radiography, an initial patchy osteolysis of the left mandibular condyle was noted. Over 18 months, serial orthopantomograms demonstrated slowly progressive osteolysis extending from the condyle through the angle toward the mandibular body on the left side. Laboratory studies showed hypocalcemia (serum calcium 4.9 mg/dL), low vitamin D (52.14 nmol/L), and low intact parathyroid hormone (14.81 pg/mL). Investigations\u2014including serologies and imaging\u2014were performed to exclude rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, eosinophilic granuloma, and other systemic diseases. A whole-body PET scan revealed no additional lytic lesions. Cone-beam CT with three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed the extent of mandibular bone loss confined to the left hemi-mandible.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nasystole\nX-linked hypophosphatemia\nvanishing bone disease\nListeria rhombencephalitis\nHereditary spherocytosis\nmyocardial infarction\nurticaria multiforme\nPseudothrombotic microangiopathy\nAutoimmuneHemolyticAnemia\n",
