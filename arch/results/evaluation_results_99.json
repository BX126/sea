The redness began after he had been gardening on a cloudy summer day. Over the next days, his elbow became swollen, blisters formed and then ruptured, leaving crusted lesions. His general practitioner suspected cellulitis and prescribed dicloxacillin. Two days after starting antibiotics, he developed an itchy rash on his chest and abdomen. On examination, there was a bright red, edematous, crusted erythema over the right elbow and a maculopapular rash on the trunk.

Normal CRP and CBC argue against cellulitis. The later trunk maculopapular rash occurred after starting dicloxacillin, suggesting a drug exanthem, but it does not explain the initial severe localized blistering at a sun-exposed site following outdoor exposure. Overall, the timing, pain/burning, sun exposure setting, bullae formation, and lack of inflammatory markers most strongly support a phototoxic reaction as the primary diagnosis.",

Intraoral examination revealed a 3\u00d74 cm exophytic mass extending from the left mandibular second molar to the retromolar pad, buccally into the vestibule and inferiorly to the floor of the mouth. Panoramic radiograph showed a well-defined radiolucency around the impacted left third molar. The lesion and the impacted tooth were excised en bloc. \n\nGrossly, the specimen included both intraosseous and extraosseous components. Histologic examination demonstrated cords, interconnecting strands, and islands of odontogenic epithelium embedded in a cell-rich, myxoid mesenchymal stroma. The epithelial strands and cords were lined by a double layer of cuboidal cells. The islands exhibited peripheral tall columnar cells with polarized nuclei and clear, vacuolated cytoplasm surrounding central stellate reticulum-like cells. Juxtaepithelial hyalinization was noted around some islands. No hard-tissue (enamel or dentin) formation was seen. The cellularity varied, with focal hypercellular areas and other sparsely cellular, myxoid regions. A thin fibrous capsule partially surrounded the lesion.

He denied Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, dyspnea, or wheezing. His blood pressure at presentation was 100\u2013110\u2009mmHg systolic, with a serum creatinine of 0.8\u2009mg/dL. He had a history of treated hepatitis B without active disease.\n\nSerologic studies showed a negative antinuclear antibody, negative anti\u2013Smith and anti\u2013ribonucleoprotein antibodies, and low-level anti\u2013topoisomerase I (3\u20134\u2009AU/mL). Nailfold capillaroscopy was suggestive of systemic sclerosis, and a skin biopsy was read as suspicious for morphea versus systemic sclerosis. Echocardiography revealed no pulmonary hypertension or pericardial effusion. He was started on mycophenolate mofetil.\n\nAn IgG \u03bb monoclonal protein of 1.1\u2009g/dL was detected. Bone marrow biopsy showed 10% \u03bb-restricted plasma cells without high-risk cytogenetics besides 1q and 5q gains, monosomy 13, and 14q deletions. Three months after presentation, for unclear reasons, he was started on high-dose prednisone (60\u2009mg daily). Shortly thereafter, his systolic blood pressure increased to 140\u2013150\u2009mmHg and serum creatinine rose to 1.1\u2009mg/dL. He developed blurry vision; ophthalmologic examination revealed cotton-wool spots. He received two intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (1.25\u2009mg each).\n\nOne week after the injections, he was admitted with severe hypertension (systolic blood pressures 200\u2013220\u2009mmHg), a rise in serum creatinine to 1.4\u2009mg/dL, and new proteinuria (urine protein-creatinine ratio 1\u2009g/g). Renal ultrasound with Doppler showed normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of renal artery stenosis. Given the abrupt hypertension, worsening renal function, proteinuria, recent corticosteroid exposure, and intravitreal VEGF blockade, scleroderma renal crisis was suspected, and a complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy related to VEGF inhibition could not be ruled out.

The pain was unchanged by position and was associated with multiple episodes of nonbloody vomiting. She was afebrile, had normal urination and bowel movements, and reported a similar, self\u2010limited episode 1 month earlier.\n\nOn examination, she was alert, without signs of systemic infection. Abdominal palpation elicited tenderness in the epigastrium; there was no guarding or rebound. Murphy\u2019s sign was positive, and there was no jaundice.\n\nLaboratory studies showed normal hepatic and biliary function tests and an elevated C-reactive protein level of 30.2 mg/L. A supine abdominal radiograph was unremarkable.\n\nInitial abdominal ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged gallbladder (54 \u00d7 34 mm) with a 3.2 mm wall thickness, pericholecystic fluid, increased pericholecystic fat, and no gallstones or intraluminal nodules. On repeat ultrasound 24 hours later, the gallbladder measured 53 \u00d7 33 mm with a 3.1 mm wall, lacked vascular flow, contained biliary sludge, and showed a cone-shaped hypoechoic structure at the neck; the fundus was displaced to the left of its fossa and moved with patient repositioning.\n\nContrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed a 53.5 \u00d7 22.8 \u00d7 31.5 mm gallbladder with an irregular, poorly enhancing wall, an intraluminal hyperdense area suggestive of hemorrhage, a 3 mm hyperdense nodule, fundus deviation to the left of the gallbladder bed, pericholecystic fluid and fat stranding, and focal hepatic perfusion abnormalities.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nKnobloch syndrome\nNonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia\nruptured hepatic metastases\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nROHHAD\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nextranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nmidbrain infarction\nCerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nExtensive macular atrophy with pseudodrusen\nembryonal rhabdomyosarcoma\nGastric submucosal arterial collaterals\nMefloquine toxicity\nAzathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nlaryngeal tuberculosis\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome\nSyphilis\nTumid lupus erythematosus\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nGallbladderVolvulus\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nMethemoglobinemia\nhypercupremia\nhypofibrinogenemia\neosinophilic myocarditis\nruptured hepatic metastases\nGiant cell myocarditis\nstress cardiomyopathy\nTakotsubo syndrome\npulmonary cryptococcosis\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis\nPhlegmonous gastritis\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nuterine artery rupture\nChondrosarcoma\nacute cerebellitis\nBinswanger disease\nendometrial stromal sarcoma\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nBehcet disease\nImmune-mediated necrotizing myopathy\npsittacosis\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nMorgellons disease\nNeuroblastoma\nFusarium proliferatum\nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia\nRosai-Dorfman disease\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\nLinearAtrophodermaOfMoulin\nHereditary spherocytosis\nKawasaki disease\npostoperative granuloma\nMyxedema coma\nintravenous leiomyomatosis\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nendometrial stromal sarcoma\nDRESS syndrome\nHelsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome\nmicrovascular angina\nHodgkin lymphoma\nGadolinium-induced acute pancreatitis\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nDieulafoy lesion\norofacial granulomatosis\nFactitious Cushing syndrome\nParaneoplastic cholestasis\nCryptococcoma\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\nLaugier\u2013Hunziker syndrome\nMirizzi syndrome\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\nEndogenous Candida endophthalmitis\nPannus formation\nGenital herpes\nneuronal intranuclear inclusion disease\nPage kidney\nCryptococcoma\nMcArdle disease\npoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis\nlympho plasmacytoma\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma\nTakayasu arteritis\nMacrophageActivationSyndrome\nIgG4-related periaortitis\nExtralobarPulmonarySequestration\nsmall cell lung cancer\nLipoma\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nanisakiasis\n",

She denied other new medications or topical products, making the vaccine the most plausible trigger. The morphology (bullae with dusky centers) and absence of mucosal involvement are characteristic of a bullous fixed drug eruption rather than infectious bullous disorders; HSV/VZV PCR from a bulla was negative, arguing against zoster or herpes. The short latency after re-exposure is consistent with fixed drug eruption behavior (often rapid upon repeat exposure).",

She had no diabetes or hypertension. Baseline ophthalmologic evaluation before SBP-101 showed 20/20 visual acuity (VA) in both eyes, normal intraocular pressures, and normal macular structure on optical coherence tomography (OCT). After the second monthly cycle of SBP-101, her VA fell to 20/50 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed pigmentary changes in the macula, with punctate hypo- and hyperautofluorescent spots on blue-autofluorescence. OCT demonstrated ellipsoid zone disruption and hyperreflective material between the Bruch membrane and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in both eyes. SBP-101 was discontinued, and intravitreal dexamethasone was administered bilaterally without improvement. One month later, VA was 20/50 OD and 20/32 OS. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) showed normal scotopic responses and photopic amplitudes at the lower limit of normal. Serum anti-recoverin and anti-enolase autoantibodies were within normal limits. Over the next five months, VA declined to 20/5000 OD and 20/4000 OS, with photopsias and severely impaired central vision. Ultra\u2013wide-field fundus photographs revealed bilateral roundish macular areas of irregular pigment loss extending beyond the vascular arcades, with scattered dot-blot hemorrhages. Blue-autofluorescence showed central hypoautofluorescence surrounded by a ring of alternating hyper- and hypoautofluorescent dots. OCT of the macula demonstrated incomplete RPE and outer retinal atrophy with signal hypertransmission to the choroid, ellipsoid zone disruption, and perifoveal hyperreflective sub-RPE deposits; choroidal thickness was reduced. Optic nerve OCT and RNFL thickness were normal. Visual fields showed bilateral central relative scotomas (VFI 26% OD, 31% OS). ERG per ISCEV standards revealed preserved dark-adapted 0.01 cd\u00b7s/m2 and mixed rod\u2013cone responses, relatively preserved a-waves on light-adapted single flashes, but reduced amplitudes and slightly prolonged implicit times on 30 Hz flicker.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nVagal paraganglioma\nHypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis\nMarginal keratitis\nChondrosarcoma\nadult-onset Still disease\nFibroma\nmicrovascular angina\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nPlasmablastic lymphoma\nBell's palsy\nBinswanger disease\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\nCardiac myxoma\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nnegative pressure pulmonary hemorrhage\nFat embolism syndrome\nEagle\u2019s syndrome\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\nTumid lupus erythematosus\nEntamoeba histolytica\nMacroprolactinoma\nChronic compartment syndrome\nWarburg micro syndrome\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\norofacial granulomatosis\nLinearAtrophodermaOfMoulin\nParaneoplastic cholestasis\nParaganglioma\nMyelinOligodendrocyteGlycoproteinAntibodyAssociatedTransverseMyelitis\ngallbladder torsion\nacute interstitial nephritis\nRetinal neovascularization\nmetastatic retinoblastoma\nSclerosing meningioma\nLinearAtrophodermaOfMoulin\nNeuroendocrine tumor\ndiabetic hemichorea hemiballismus\nLaugier-Hunziker syndrome\nintravenous leiomyomatosis\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nHyperplastic parathyroid gland seeding\nhypofibrinogenemia\nPituitary metastasis\nprostatic utricle\nIris stromal proliferation\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults\ncentral diabetes insipidus\nWernicke encephalopathy\nMarginal keratitis\ncold agglutinin disease\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nAcinic cell carcinoma\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nNeuromyelitisOpticaSpectrumDisorder\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\nneuroendocrine carcinoma\nMyopericarditis\nPsychogenicMovementDisorder\nTumid lupus erythematosus\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis\nMacroprolactinoma\nbilateral paramedian thalamic infarction\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nlympho plasmacytoma\nCardiac metastasis\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\nSclerosing meningioma\nischemic chiasmopathy\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nSBP-101 induced retinal toxicity\nMulticentric reticulohistiocytosis\nhydrocephalus\nMalignant melanoma\nMycobacterium haemophilum\nTyrosinemia type I\nHepatic bartonellosis\nStrumaOvarii\nMirizzi syndrome\nMyofibrillar myopathy\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nsingle-organ vasculitis\nCentral-variant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nMirizzi syndrome\nFactitious disorder\nBorderline tuberculoid leprosy\nmalignant catatonia\nUrticarialFixedDrugEruption\nBorderline tuberculoid leprosy\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nWarburg micro syndrome\nleft atrial thrombus\nSclerosing meningioma\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nSMARCA4-DTS\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage\n",

On examination he was comatose with a blood pressure of 178/121 mmHg, heart rate 105 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 of 15; he required intubation and ICU admission. He had no history of epilepsy, head trauma, recreational drug use, smoking, or alcohol consumption. His medical history was notable for resistant hypertension diagnosed 20 years ago, treated with atenolol 50 mg, spironolactone 100 mg, amlodipine 10 mg, and valsartan 160 mg daily, with poor compliance, and for type II diabetes mellitus treated with a sulfonylurea. Family history was positive for hypertension but negative for renal disease or adrenal tumors. Body mass index was 31. Thyroid and visual-field examinations were normal, and there were no cushingoid or acromegaly features. Initial laboratory studies showed a potassium level of 2.6 mmol/L (normal 3.6\u20135.1), creatinine 113 \u03bcmol/L, metabolic alkalosis on blood gas analysis, urea 5.7 mmol/L, and creatine kinase 2.2 \u03bcg/L. Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrites. A chest radiograph showed no signs of heart failure. ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm. Troponin-T and BNP were within normal limits. Calcium was 2.46 mmol/L. CT of the brain showed no lesions, and MRI the next day revealed no mass-occupying lesion; EEG was normal. Repeat potassium remained low at 2.6 mmol/L; plasma aldosterone was 36.2 ng/dL (normal 2.8\u201315.8), and plasma renin was < 0.081 ng/dL (normal 0.4\u20132.3). A 24-hour urine collection excluded Cushing\u2019s syndrome and pheochromocytoma.

Neurologic examination revealed that he was alert and had no motor or sensory deficits, but he noted narrowing of the left lower visual field quadrant. Noncontrast CT of the head showed a 5-cm, well-circumscribed, high-density mass in the right parietal region without calcification. MRI demonstrated an extra-axial lesion that was iso\u2010intense on T1-weighted imaging, uniformly very low in signal on T2-weighted imaging, and showed marked enhancement after gadolinium administration. There was no diffusion restriction after correction for a T2 blackout effect. The mass was separate from the ventricles and was associated with a large anterior cyst whose contents had a signal different from cerebrospinal fluid; the cyst wall did not enhance, consistent with a peritumoral cyst, and there was surrounding edema. The tumor contacted the dura mater convexity and the falx cerebri but lacked an obvious attachment or dural tail sign. Time-resolved MR angiography (4D-TRAK) showed no tumor staining or feeding vessels, suggesting low vascularity. Routine blood tests, including tumor markers, were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no extracranial source of malignancy.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nSarcoidosis\nNeuromyelitisOpticaSpectrumDisorder\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nIntraosseous meningioma\nX-linked hypophosphatemia\nUnilateral absence of a pulmonary artery\nchemical abscess\nFetus in fetu\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nRetinal neovascularization\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nK\u00fcttner's tumor\nErosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp\nChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nMetastatic melanoma\nRenal replacement lipomatosis\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nHypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nHypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nCryptococcoma\nFemale adnexal tumor of probable Wolffian origin\nGranular cell tumor\nCancer of unknown primary\nprimary adrenal insufficiency\nbiliary foreign body\nPsoriasis\nTropheryma whipplei endocarditis\nconjunctival cyst\nFolateDeficientOpticNeuropathy\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\nPPP syndrome\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nMeasles\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nMahaim pathway tachycardia due to triggered activity\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nPsoriasis\nEosinophilic gastritis\nExtracutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum\nReel syndrome\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nOculomotor mononeuropathy\nLaugier-Hunziker syndrome\nMorgellons disease\ntorsion of a subserosal uterine leiomyoma\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nReactive arthritis\nDisseminated tuberculosis\nPachydermoperiostosis\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nGranulocytic sarcoma\nAmyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\nSclerosing meningioma\nhyperinsulinaemic reactive hypoglycemia\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nIntraosseous meningioma\nRetinal neovascularization\nRelapsing polychondritis\nCOVID toes\nLeydig cell tumor of the ovary\nMidventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\nSteroid-responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis\nmelanoma\nExtranodal marginal zone lymphoma\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nMalignant melanoma\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nGerm cell tumor\nTakotsubo syndrome\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nCystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis\nEwing sarcoma\nJunctionalEctopicTachycardia\nneonatal breast enlargement\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\nsporotrichosis\nFibroma\nneuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus\neosinophilic myocarditis\nFibroma\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nAreca nut toxicity\nposterior elbow impingement\nCentral-variant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nneonatal breast enlargement\nRecurrentGuillainBarreSyndrome\n",

She was asymptomatic between episodes and could predict their onset. She had a history of childhood tonsillitis treated with tonsillectomy. She worked in black metal analysis for over 30 years.  \n\nDuring episodes, laboratory studies showed CRP 64 mg/L, serum amyloid A 140 mg/L, leukocytes 2.94 \u00d7 10^9/L, and neutrophils 3.19 \u00d7 10^9/L; procalcitonin, immunoglobulins, and ANA titres were normal. HIV, CMV, EBV, and other infection indicators were negative, and blood and throat cultures showed no growth. PET-CT demonstrated increased glucose metabolism in the sigmoid colon, but colonoscopy was normal. Pharyngoscopy revealed pharyngitis with white exudate. Ultrasound showed enlarged bilateral cervical, submandibular, and supraclavicular lymph nodes (up to 21 \u00d7 6 mm), and a supraclavicular lymph node biopsy revealed reactive hyperplasia. Bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetics were unremarkable.

His medical history included chronic ischemic heart disease status post coronary-artery bypass grafting, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease.  \n\nOn arrival, he reported several days of worsening leg and shoulder pain with an inability to walk independently. Vital signs showed hypotension, and an electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, a left bundle-branch block, ST-segment depression, and peaked, high T waves. Laboratory tests demonstrated a troponin T level of 532\u2009ng/L (normal <\u200914\u2009ng/L) and NT-proBNP of 5579\u2009ng/L (normal <\u2009125\u2009ng/L). A temporary pacemaker was placed because of bradyarrhythmia.  \n\nUrgent coronary angiography showed severe three-vessel atheromatous disease with an 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and sub-occlusive lesions in the right coronary artery, which was successfully stented. During the procedure, he developed cardiogenic shock, treated with vasopressors and inotropic support. Arterial blood gas analysis disclosed a metabolic acidosis (pH 7.26) and a serum potassium concentration of 7.5\u2009mmol/L.  \n\nHe was admitted to the intensive care unit.

On arrival, her pulse was 112/min, respiratory rate 19/min, blood pressure 93/62 mm\u2009Hg, and temperature 36 \u00b0C. Physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologically, she was drowsy and disoriented (GCS 14/15), with impaired memory, visual hallucinations, and an unsteady gait; deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and plantar responses were flexor. Initial blood tests showed acute respiratory acidosis and mildly elevated liver enzymes; serum sodium was 135 mEq/L, BUN 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.49 mg/dL. Chest radiography revealed a slight increase in bilateral lung markings. Brain CT was normal. \n\nIn the pediatric ICU, lumbar puncture showed CSF with protein 26 mg/dL, glucose 82 mg/dL, and 5 lymphocytes/\u03bcL. Twelve hours after admission, she developed complex partial seizures with secondary generalization and was started on phenytoin and acyclovir. By day 3, seizures increased in frequency with auditory and visual hallucinations; MRI was normal. Serologies were negative for HSV I/II, CMV, and EBV IgM, but Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM was positive (3.44), and a 5-day course of azithromycin was begun. Blood and CSF cultures remained sterile. EEG showed diffuse slowing, rhythmic parietal\u2013temporal discharges, and left parietal spikes. By day 4, seizures progressed to generalized myoclonic type despite levetiracetam, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and valproate, and her consciousness declined to GCS E2V2M5. \n\nOn day 6, she developed marked polyuria: intake 1324 mL versus output 2606 mL, with signs of dehydration (decreased skin turgor, tachycardia, 0.6\u2009kg weight loss). Laboratory evaluation revealed serum sodium 112 mmol/L, serum osmolality 227 mOsm/kg, urine sodium 129 mmol/L, urine osmolality 437 mOsm/kg, and a fractional excretion of sodium of 2.76\u00d710\u207b\u00b2.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\noromandibular limb hypogenesis syndrome\nMycobacterium marinum\nMucosal neuroma syndrome\nOvarian torsion\nMycosis fungoides\nNeoplastic parkinsonism\nPortosystemic shunt\nB-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia\nFourth branchial cleft anomaly\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nHistiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma\nGanglioneuroma\nacquired hemophilia\nSecondary syphilis\nChikungunya virus infection\nMacrophageActivationSyndrome\nmembranous glomerulonephritis\nFusarium proliferatum\nLaugier\u2013Hunziker syndrome\ntumor-induced osteomalacia\nROHHAD\nOccupational acro-osteolysis\nMycobacterium kansasii\nMicronodular thymic carcinoma with lymphoid hyperplasia\nCOVID-19 myocarditis\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor\nInsulinAutoimmuneSyndrome\nHepatocellularcarcinomawithbiliaryandneuroendocrinedifferentiation\nMyxoma\nconjunctival cyst\nKapur-Toriello syndrome\nDistal renal tubular acidosis\nnodular regenerative hyperplasia\nMOGHE\npronator teres syndrome\nsulfonylurea poisoning\nStreptococcus salivarius pneumonia\nBucillamine-induced pneumonitis\nMycobacterium haemophilum\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nSMARCA4-DTS\ncold agglutinin disease\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\nRasmussen's encephalitis\nRelapsing polychondritis\nAbusive abdominal trauma\nmyocardial infarction\nBehcet disease\nVaricella zoster virus infection\ndecompression retinopathy\nscleredema adultorum of Buschke\nIntestinal tuberculosis\nNeoplastic parkinsonism\nMultipleSclerosis\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\nPanton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia\nhypothyroidism\nSchizophrenia\nMalakoplakia\nGiant cell myocarditis\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\ncystic lymphangioma\nFirst bite syndrome\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nCystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\nInfective endocarditis\nParathyroidAdenoma\nIris stromal proliferation\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nHereditary spherocytosis\nHemorrhagic pericardial effusion from blunt chest trauma\nBurkittLymphoma\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nCystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis\nSMART syndrome\nSebaceous carcinoma\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nPituitary abscess\nRosaiDorfmanDisease\nReninoma\ndiabetic hemichorea hemiballismus\nThrombocytopenia-associated multiorgan failure\nBrucellosis\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\ntorsion of a subserosal uterine leiomyoma\nBardet\u2010Biedl syndrome\nvaricella zoster virus encephalitis\nNeoplastic parkinsonism\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nObesity-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\nEwing sarcoma\nAdhesive small bowel obstruction\nAbusive abdominal trauma\n",

Her past ocular history included bilateral epiretinal membranes. Medical history was notable for nonspecific joint disease managed with low-dose prednisone and methotrexate, and pulmonary symptoms of unclear etiology for which she was also on low-dose prednisone. \n\nOn examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. Intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OU. Slit-lamp examination showed nuclear sclerotic cataracts OU (2+ OD, 1+ OS) without cell or flare. Dilated fundus examination revealed 0.5+ vitreous haze OU and mild vessel attenuation OU. Spectral-domain OCT showed preserved foveal contour without sub- or intraretinal fluid. Wide-angle fluorescein angiography demonstrated mild bilateral peripheral perivascular leakage.\n\nInitial laboratory tests including liver function, basic metabolic panel, hemoglobin A1c, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, QuantiFERON, syphilis serologies, anti\u2013dsDNA, and chest radiography were within normal limits, except for a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1:80. Complete blood count showed leukocytosis (11.6 K/\u00b5L) and anemia (hemoglobin 11.6 g/dL; previously 10.2 g/dL one year earlier).\n\nMethotrexate was discontinued; the patient was started on mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg twice daily and prednisone 20 mg daily. Two months later, visual acuity remained stable (20/25 OD, 20/20 OS), but repeat fluorescein angiography showed worsening peripheral perivascular leakage.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nGiant bullous emphysema\nMetastatic melanoma\nSegmental arterial mediolysis\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nextrauterine adenomyoma\nFactitious Cushing syndrome\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\ncold agglutinin disease\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nIntestinal tuberculosis\nfunctional dysphagia\nPsoriasis\nmicrovascular angina\ngranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis\nPsoriasis\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nFactor XIIII deficiency\nCardiacSarcoidosis\ngranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis\nWernicke encephalopathy\nCOVID toes\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\nmixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumor\nIntracardiac metastasis\nflecainide pneumonitis\nWarm autoimmune hemolytic anemia\nDRESS syndrome\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\nTuberculosis\nROHHAD\nGanglioneuroma\nRecurrentGuillainBarreSyndrome\nCryptococcoma\nCervical carcinoma\nprostatic utricle\nRelationship disappointment stress syndrome\njuvenile granulosa cell tumor\nmidbrain infarction\nPrimary aldosteronism\nGitelman's syndrome\nAndersen\u2013Tawil syndrome\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nNeuroborreliosis\nnecrotizing autoimmune myopathy\nSecondary syphilis\nradicular cyst\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nMyelinOligodendrocyteGlycoproteinAntibodyAssociatedTransverseMyelitis\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nDuodromic tachycardia\nneuroendocrine carcinoma\nIntestinal tuberculosis\nCentral-variant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nRenalArteryOcclusion\nHistoplasmosis\nConstrictive pericarditis\nMefloquine toxicity\nPrimary aldosteronism\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\ncompartment syndrome\nCardiac amyloidosis\nepinephrine toxicity\nparaproteinemic keratopathy\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nneuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus\nrenal artery aneurysm\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\nAbusive abdominal trauma\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nvanishing bone disease\nDiaphragmatic amyloidosis\nneurotoxoplasmosis\nJapanese encephalitis\nneuroendocrine carcinoma\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma\norofacial granulomatosis\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nNeonatal severe hyperparathyroidism\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nJapanese encephalitis\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nuterine leiomyosarcoma\nDrug-induced lung injury\nleiomyosarcoma\nDrug-induced myopathy\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\ngranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis\nthyroid adenocarcinoma\nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia\nIgG4-related periaortitis\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nPfeifer-Weber-Christian disease\n",

She had been treated elsewhere for presumed bacterial conjunctivitis with topical ofloxacin without improvement. Over the previous 4\u20136 weeks she had chronic nasal obstruction, noisy breathing, and rhinolalia, and for 7 days she had purulent anterior rhinorrhea.  \nOn examination, she had erythematous, tender, and edematous right upper and lower eyelids with an S-shaped palpebral swelling and overlying erythema at the site of the lacrimal sac. There was painful palpation at the nasal canthus but no ocular discharge. Nasal mucosae were swollen. Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy was present, more marked on the right. Neurologic examination, ocular motility, and funduscopy were normal, with visual acuity 20/20 bilaterally and no proptosis or relative afferent pupillary defect. Throat and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.  \nLaboratory studies showed a normal white-cell count with a left shift, C-reactive protein 22 mg/L, and normal procalcitonin.  \nContrast CT of the head revealed right preseptal soft-tissue infiltration and a well-delimited ipsilateral 11 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 13 mm collection with rim enhancement suggestive of a periorbital abscess; there were no signs of acute sinusitis or intracranial extension. Multiple bilateral cervical lymph nodes were also noted.  \nIntravenous co-amoxiclav (100 mg/kg/day) and topical neomycin\u2013polymyxin B were initiated. Over the next 3 days, fever persisted, and a fluctuating lump developed in the nasolacrimal region. Systemic corticosteroids were added. No spontaneous purulent discharge occurred, and blood cultures plus eye-swab cultures remained negative. Surgical drainage was considered, and EBV serology was sent.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nFunctionalNeurologicalDisorder\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nGliomatosis cerebri\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nAdenosine-sensitive atrial tachycardia\nIntracardiac metastasis\nadrenal hemorrhage\nmetastatic retinoblastoma\npronator teres syndrome\nPituitary abscess\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\nSegmental arterial mediolysis\nmucous extravasation phenomenon\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nLeft atrial tachycardia\nReel syndrome\nEmphysematous cystitis\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nAnomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery\nAnaplasmosis\nRheumatoid nodules\nTuberculosis\nMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor\nnodular pulmonary amyloidosis\nHodgkin lymphoma\nlepromatous leprosy\nMedullary thyroid carcinoma\nCalyceal rupture\nhydrocephalus\nTuberculosis\nprimary adrenal insufficiency\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nGliomatosis cerebri\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nPhlegmonous gastritis\ncerebral granulomatosis\nparaganglioma\npseudoaneurysm\nHDR syndrome\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nQFever\nNeurosyphilis\nCeliac disease\nGerm cell tumor\nSubependymoma\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus infection\nBinswanger disease\nK\u00fcttner's tumor\nCardiac metastasis\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nAdrenal insufficiency\nMetastatic melanoma\nNeurofibroma\nLipoma\nMOGHE\nPrimary hepatic lymphoma\nscleredema adultorum of Buschke\nlaryngeal tuberculosis\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nHypertrophic osteoarthropathy\nInsulinoma\nMahaim pathway tachycardia due to triggered activity\nNesidioblastosis\nneuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus\nAzathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome\nneuronal intranuclear inclusion disease\nReel syndrome\nrheumatoid meningitis\nPhototoxic reaction\nNeurofibroma\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nCerebral edema\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nnon-small cell lung cancer\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\nbilateral acute depigmentation of iris\nparaproteinemic keratopathy\nIsolated arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy\nBirt-Hogg-Dub\u00e8 syndrome\nReninoma\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nGallbladderVolvulus\nsubglottic cyst\nReactive arthritis\nPeripheralUlcerativeKeratitis\nprostatic utricle\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\nmicrovascular angina\nnodular pulmonary amyloidosis\nmembranous glomerulonephritis\nopioid-induced catatonia\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\nSarcoidosis\nprostatic utricle\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n",

Forty-five days before presentation her regimen was changed to zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine because of gastrointestinal intolerance. Twenty days after starting nevirapine the rash and jaundice began. \n\nOn examination: temperature 39.0\u00b0C; blood pressure 95/66 mm Hg; marked conjunctival and skin icterus; diffuse maculopapular rash covering >50% of body surface; no lymphadenopathy; abdomen soft with tenderness in the right hypochondrium; no hepatosplenomegaly; neurologic examination normal.\n\nLaboratory studies showed: normal complete blood count and differential; normal glucose, electrolytes, and pancreatic enzymes; elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase; acute kidney injury with a threefold increase in serum creatinine and a 75% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Testing was negative for cytomegalovirus antigenemia, hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B and C antibodies. An electrocardiogram was normal.

Cerebral and spinal MRI findings were unremarkable. Workup for myasthenia gravis was negative, with normal nerve conduction studies and no acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis was ruled out by short/long exercise tests and genetic analysis of SCN4A, KCNJ18, KCNJ2, and CACNA1S. He underwent a 4-week in-patient rehabilitation program and fully recovered within 6 months.\n\nSecond episode (one year later): He presented to the emergency department with a panic attack manifesting as acute hyperventilation and anxiety, accompanied by paresthesia and tetany in all four limbs. It was unclear whether the sensorimotor symptoms preceded or followed the panic attack. He reported normal physical activity and a balanced diet in the preceding months.\n\nOn examination, he had tetraparesis with muscle strength of 4/5 (Medical Research Council scale), a positive Trousseau\u2019s sign on the right hand, normal cranial nerves, no sensory deficit, and normal deep tendon and plantar reflexes. Gait and balance were not assessed in the acute setting.\n\nArterial blood gas analysis showed acute respiratory alkalosis: pH 7.57 (NR 7.35\u20137.45), PaCO\u2082 19.2 mmHg (NR 30\u201345 mmHg), PaO\u2082 105 mmHg (NR 82.5\u2013105 mmHg), HCO\u2083\u207b 17.7 mmol/L (NR 22\u201326 mmol/L), and a base excess of \u20131.3 mmol/L (NR \u00b12\u20133 mmol/L). Blood chemistry revealed severe hypophosphatemia (0.2 mmol/L) and rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase 44 913 U/L; AST 397 U/L; ALT 133 U/L). Other blood tests, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B9, B12, amino acids, and TSH, were normal. Urinalysis showed no renal phosphate loss.

Her medical history was unremarkable, with no cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, or tuberous sclerosis complex. On examination she had mild hepatomegaly without palpable mass or jaundice. Liver function tests and tumor markers (AFP, CEA) were within normal limits.  \nAbdominal ultrasonography revealed a solitary, heterogeneous, hypoechoic mass in the liver with an ill-defined margin; color Doppler imaging demonstrated abundant blood flow at the lesion\u2019s periphery. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 6.4 \u00d7 8.0 cm low-density mass in segment IV with inhomogeneous enhancement in the portal phase. MRI confirmed a lesion that was hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and showed strong heterogeneous enhancement after gadolinium administration. There was no lymphadenopathy, portal vein involvement, or other lesions.  \nGiven the hypervascular nature of the mass, its lack of adipose tissue, and absence of thick-walled vessels, the lesion was initially interpreted as a hemangioma, an atypical hepatocellular carcinoma, or a metastatic focus. Because of the patient\u2019s worsening symptoms and indeterminate imaging findings, a central segmentectomy of the liver with cholecystectomy was performed.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nischemic chiasmopathy\nWhipple\u2019s disease\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nOrbital myositis\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nPulmonary carcinoid\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nsebaceous carcinoma\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nepinephrine toxicity\nMyopericarditis\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas\ntoxin-induced leukoencephalopathy\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nLeptospirosis\nepiploic appendage band\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nMycobacterium avium complex\nIron refractory iron deficiency anemia\ncaseous mitral annular calcification\nBartonella neuroretinitis\nvanishing bone disease\nPEComa\nEwing sarcoma\nadrenal hemorrhage\nfunctional dysphagia\nMyxedema coma\nshiitake dermatitis\nscleredema adultorum of Buschke\nPhlegmonous gastritis\nTuberculosis\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\nAnomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\nCardiac metastasis\nmeningoencephalocele\nthymoma\nchemical abscess\nautoimmune myelofibrosis\nJapanese encephalitis\ntoxin-induced leukoencephalopathy\ngerminoma\nbiliary foreign body\nSecondary syphilis\nCardiac angiosarcoma\nGemcitabine\u2010induced skin necrosis\nKaposi sarcoma\nNeuroblastoma\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nNeuromyelitisOpticaSpectrumDisorder\nVismodegib-induced diarrhea\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nMacrophage activation syndrome\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nAdult onset Still's disease\ncompartment syndrome\nExtensive macular atrophy with pseudodrusen\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nOccupational acro-osteolysis\niatrogenic aortic dissection\nSBP-101 induced retinal toxicity\nAnaplasmosis\nAbusive abdominal trauma\nSebaceous carcinoma\nNonfunctioningPituitaryMacroadenoma\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nmalignant catatonia\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nPsychogenicMovementDisorder\nGerm cell tumor\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nSMARCA4-DTS\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\ncemento-ossifying fibroma\nmiliary tuberculosis\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nKawasaki disease\nGranulocytic sarcoma\nLeft atrial tachycardia\nepithelioid trophoblastic tumor\nendometrial stromal sarcoma\nMeningioma\nNeuromyelitisOpticaSpectrumDisorder\nNoonan syndrome\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nGiant cell tumor of the breast\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus\u2013positive mucocutaneous ulcer\nKimura\u2019s disease\nAdultOnsetStillsDisease\nJapanese encephalitis\n",

He reported right foot slap and tripping on uneven ground, later developing bilateral foot drop, exercise-related leg fatigue, and mild difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a low chair. There was no bulbar or upper-limb involvement. He also described sensory loss in both feet to mid-shin level with mild superficial dysesthesia. A prior workup suggested bilateral L5 radiculopathy, but lumbar MRI was normal.\n\nOn examination, there was no obvious muscle atrophy. Manual strength testing revealed isolated distal lower-limb weakness: ankle dorsiflexion 2/5 on the right, 4\u2013/5 on the left; inversion and eversion 4/5; plantar flexion difficulty when standing on toes. Hip girdle and thigh strength were 5/5. Pinprick and light-touch sensation were reduced in a length-dependent distribution; vibration and proprioception were intact. Reflexes were 1+ in the upper limbs and absent at the knees and ankles.\n\nLaboratory studies showed normal CBC, vitamin B12, TSH, serum protein electrophoresis, hemoglobin A1c, paraneoplastic antibodies, and renal and liver function tests. Creatine kinase was mildly elevated at 508 U/L. A 30-gene Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth panel was negative. Because EMG showed myotonic potentials, genetic testing for myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 was performed and was negative.\n\nNerve conduction studies revealed mildly reduced peroneal and tibial CMAP amplitudes with normal distal latencies and conduction velocities. Sensory nerve conduction studies were within normal limits. Needle EMG demonstrated fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and polyphasic, long-duration motor-unit potentials with reduced recruitment in the tibialis anterior (most prominent) and gastrocnemius. Prominent myotonic discharges were also noted in several muscles. The biceps brachii and vastus lateralis were normal. Overall, these findings were interpreted as consistent with a predominantly motor length-dependent polyneuropathy.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome\nRosai\u2013Dorfman disease\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nMyocarditis\nWilson's disease\nExtracutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nErdheim-Chester disease\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nintravascular large B-cell lymphoma\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nParaganglioma\nAdhesive small bowel obstruction\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nPPP syndrome\nFamilial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification\nMycobacterium haemophilum\nHereditary hemochromatosis\nProstate adenocarcinoma\nToxoplasmosis\nHypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis\nPeritoneal tuberculosis\nMalakoplakia\nsubpleural pulmonary cysts\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nxanthoma disseminatum\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nPsychogenicMovementDisorder\nGliomatosis cerebri\nAutoimmuneHemolyticAnemia\nRecurrent polychondritis\nMultiple sclerosis\nsubglottic cyst\nPituitary metastasis\nScrub typhus\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\ndedifferentiated liposarcoma\nGCSFAortitis\nparaduodenal pancreatitis\nwound botulism\nleprosy\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nMyofibrillar myopathy\nLuschka duct cyst\nPleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma\nBehcet disease\nprostatic utricle\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nMembranous aplasia cutis congenita\nMucosal neuroma syndrome\nMycobacterium haemophilum\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\nMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nmyocardial infarction\ncerebral arterial air embolism\nHemosuccusPancreaticus\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nsubpleural pulmonary cysts\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nPericardialanisakiasis\ndrug-induced bilateral acute angle closure\nBehcet disease\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nbilateral acute depigmentation of iris\nmyocardial infarction\nAreca nut toxicity\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nErdheim-Chester disease\nErosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp\nIris stromal proliferation\nMedullary thyroid carcinoma\nSerpentine-like syndrome\nleiomyosarcoma\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\nIgG4-related periaortitis\nDrug-induced lung injury\npulmonary artery vasculitis\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nIris stromal proliferation\nNonfunctioningPituitaryMacroadenoma\nFat embolism syndrome\narachnoid cyst\nFetus in fetu\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\nANCA-associated vasculitis\nCervical carcinoma\nTuberculosis\nNeuroblastoma\nEwing sarcoma\nIris stromal proliferation\nNonurachal adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder\nleiomyosarcoma\nsebaceous carcinoma\nDistal defect of the humerus\ndiabetic myonecrosis\nTumid lupus erythematosus\n",

She was found to be severely anemic (hemoglobin, 6 g/dL) but denied hematuria, postmenopausal bleeding, or gastrointestinal bleeding; occult blood in stool and red cells in urine were negative. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Renal ultrasonography demonstrated left hydronephrosis; all other abdominal organs appeared normal. Intravenous pyelogram showed an opacity in the left renal region exerting mass effect on the pelvi\u2010calyceal system. Contrast\u2010enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed a 9.0 \u00d7 7.5 cm solid, enhancing soft\u2010tissue mass with focal necrosis, inseparable from the medial left kidney, displacing the kidney laterally and compressing the collecting system. At exploratory laparotomy, a radical nephrectomy specimen measured 17 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 8 cm. The cut surface showed a well\u2010circumscribed, lobulated, firm, gray\u2010white mass (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 cm) in the lower pole, with a whorled appearance, focal necrosis, and myxoid degeneration, displacing the pelvis. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of interlacing fascicles and whorls of spindle cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval-to\u2010cigar\u2010shaped nuclei with moderate pleomorphism, 20\u201325 mitoses per 10 high\u2010power fields, and approximately 20% of the tumor showing hemorrhage and necrosis; no epithelial component or perinephric infiltration was identified. Immunohistochemical analysis showed diffuse strong positivity for smooth muscle actin, desmin, and vimentin; epithelial membrane antigen was focally positive, while pancytokeratin and high\u2010molecular\u2010weight cytokeratin were negative.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nRetinal neovascularization\nmeningoencephalocele\nlorlatinib toxicity\nUterine adenosarcoma\nTumid lupus erythematosus\nPulmonary embolism\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\nUnilateral absence of a pulmonary artery\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nMultilocularThymicCyst\nBurkittLymphoma\nEndogenous Candida endophthalmitis\norganized thrombus\nthymoma\nPulmonary carcinoid\npulmonary bulla\nRosai-Dorfman disease\nstress cardiomyopathy\nCervical carcinoma\nFusarium proliferatum\nHereditary spherocytosis\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nBucillamine-induced pneumonitis\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nNeuromyelitisOpticaSpectrumDisorder\nSolitary fibrous tumor\nBorderline tuberculoid leprosy\nDRESS syndrome\nColistin neurotoxicity\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nPfeifer-Weber-Christian disease\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nParaneoplastic morphea\nSubclavian artery stenosis\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nTubulocystic renal cell carcinoma\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nPEComa\nExogenous androgen exposure\nMycobacterium avium complex\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nstiff RA syndrome\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nUrticarialFixedDrugEruption\nsyphilis\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nrenal arteriovenous malformation\nAzathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome\nLeiomyosarcoma\nExtracutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum\nHypertrophic osteoarthropathy\nDrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\nEnamel hypoplasia\nNiclosamide-induced maculopathy\nEctopic liver tissue\nscurvy\nNeoplastic parkinsonism\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\nListeria rhombencephalitis\nWernicke encephalopathy\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus\nancient schwannoma\nAdrenal insufficiency\nEntamoeba histolytica\nRheumatoid nodules\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nthyroid adenocarcinoma\nParaneoplastic morphea\nIntramuscular hemangioma\nBrucellosis\nNiclosamide-induced maculopathy\nrheumatoid meningitis\nMetaplastic carcinoma\nIris stromal proliferation\nCoronaryArterySpasm\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nGerminoma\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nIntracardiac metastasis\nReactive arthritis\nendometrial stromal sarcoma\nAcquired hemophilia A\nMembranous nephropathy\nRelapsing polychondritis\nHepatocellularcarcinomawithbiliaryandneuroendocrinedifferentiation\nMethanol toxicity\nancient schwannoma\nSLE myocarditis\nsuperior orbital fissure syndrome\nRetinal neovascularization\nMycobacterium marinum infection\nTransverse myelitis\ntuberculous mediastinal abscess\nBardet\u2010Biedl syndrome\nLoeys-Dietz syndrome\nBalo concentric sclerosis\nSLE myocarditis\n",

She reported paresthesia in both feet beginning 2 months earlier, progressing over 2 weeks to her trunk at the level of the umbilicus, and a similar episode in both hands about 1 year prior. She had no significant past medical history, took no medications, and denied illicit drug, tobacco, or alcohol use. On examination, she had complete bilateral horizontal gaze palsy in the horizontal plane while vertical gaze was intact aside from slightly decreased saccadic velocity. Pupils were midsize and reactive; there was no nystagmus, diplopia, or blurred vision. Mild bilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy was present. Hyperreflexia was noted in all four limbs without clonus; plantar reflexes were downgoing; muscle strength, tone, and coordination were normal. Brain MRI showed multiple hyperintense subcortical and periventricular lesions on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, and bilateral hyperintensities in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) at the level of the pons.

She reported chronic vision loss in the right eye but denied headache or trauma. On examination, she was alert; oriented to person, place, and time; and disoriented to situation. Visual acuity was reduced in the right eye. Muscle strength was 4/5 in the left triceps, wrist flexors, wrist extensors, and finger flexors, and 3/5 in the left finger extensors. The left triceps reflex was absent. Sensation to pinprick and light touch was decreased in the left fourth and fifth digits. There was no dysmetria or dysdiadokokinesia. Head CT without contrast showed a 1 cm hyperdense round lesion in the suprasellar cistern.\n\nOn hospital day 2, she developed a pupil-sparing right third cranial nerve palsy, which progressed the next day to a dilated, nonreactive right pupil. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brachial plexus and spine was unrevealing. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed enhancing lesions with heterogeneous signal intensity in the suprasellar, pineal, and right periatrial regions, without evidence of acute ischemic stroke. One week later, repeat brain MRI demonstrated interval enlargement of these lesions and focal right frontoparietal dural thickening. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast showed multiple thyroid nodules concerning for metastases. Two serial lumbar punctures yielded lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and an elevated IgG index but no malignant cells or other inflammatory or infectious markers.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nCancerAssociatedRetinopathy\nextrauterine adenomyoma\nRheumatoid nodules\nsporotrichosis\nautosensitization reaction\nPeritoneal tuberculosis\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nMultiple sclerosis\nlepromatous leprosy\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nextrauterine adenomyoma\nAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma\nLarge vessel vasculitis\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\ndecompression retinopathy\ncerebral arterial air embolism\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\nneurotoxoplasmosis\nscurvy\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nmelanoma\nMiller Fisher syndrome\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nPortosystemic shunt\npseudoprogression\nInsulinAutoimmuneSyndrome\nmelanoma\nbiliary foreign body\nMyopericarditis\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nAcinic cell carcinoma\nAtypical mastocytoma\nPleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma\nbullous fixed drug eruption\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nMorphea\nAcquired hemophilia A\nAutoimmuneHemolyticAnemia\nMorphea\ncryptogenic embolic stroke\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma\ngraft rejection\nFactor XIIII deficiency\nWilson's disease\nExtraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nAreca nut toxicity\nposterior elbow impingement\nMarginal keratitis\nTuberculosis\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nstiff RA syndrome\nstiff RA syndrome\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nRecurrentGuillainBarreSyndrome\nHepatic bartonellosis\nCholinergic urticaria\nPulmonary carcinoid\nbilateral basal ganglia infarction\nSchwannoma\nAortopulmonary artery fistula\nChikungunya virus infection\nBalo concentric sclerosis\nWarburg micro syndrome\nEmphysematous cystitis\nLeydig cell tumor of the ovary\nGiant cell myocarditis\nacquired hemophilia\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nThrombocytopenia-associated multiorgan failure\nAndersen\u2013Tawil syndrome\nvaricella zoster virus encephalitis\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nAnaphylaxis\nasystole\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nCancer of unknown primary\nAdenocarcinoma of the lesser omentum\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nBrownTumor\nOxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia\nParaganglioma\nMyxoma\nMeropenem-induced thrombocytopenia\nAmyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\nfunctional dysphagia\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nGitelman's syndrome\nbilateral basal ganglia infarction\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus\u2013positive mucocutaneous ulcer\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nlorlatinib toxicity\nSertoli-Leydig cell tumor\n",

She had an unremarkable physical examination at birth and passed meconium within 24 hours. Maternal breast milk feeds were initiated by gavage on day 1 of life. \n\nOn day 4, after episodes of bilious emesis, she was made nil per os. Examination showed a distended, tender abdomen without rebound and normoactive bowel sounds; the remainder of her exam, including genitourinary assessment, was normal. Laboratory studies on day 4 revealed a white-cell count of 21.1\u00d710^9/L with 14% eosinophils. \n\nBy day 5, she developed frank bloody stools. Serial abdominal radiographs showed nonspecific bowel gas fullness without pneumatosis. An upper gastrointestinal series ruled out malrotation. Although abdominal distention resolved by day 6, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and hematochezia persisted. Family history was notable for a sister with milk-protein intolerance who developed hematochezia after milk exposure. \n\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin and cefepime) were started on day 5. On day 7, ampicillin was replaced with vancomycin after an abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate for ischemia, intussusception, and colitis; the ultrasound showed several subcentimeter hypoechoic, hypovascular liver lesions characterized as microabscesses, scattered loops of thick-walled bowel with minimal ascites, a sludge-filled gallbladder, and no biliary ductal dilatation. There was no pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, portal venous gas, or complex ascites. \n\nOn day 8, a contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed irregular hypodensities in the anterior right hepatic lobe consistent with microabscesses and demonstrated mild mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel-wall thickening of the rectosigmoid.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nappendicitis\nHypokalemic paralysis\nScleroderma_renal_crisis\nAdult onset Still's disease\nBirt-Hogg-Dub\u00e8 syndrome\nBirt-Hogg-Dub\u00e8 syndrome\nancient schwannoma\nBecker muscular dystrophy\nCat scratch disease\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nPPP syndrome\nVaricella zoster virus infection\nPrimary empty sella syndrome\nPrimary generalized epilepsy\nLarge vessel vasculitis\nIdiopathic carotidynia\nNeuroendocrine carcinoma\nDiabetic myonecrosis\nTIPIC syndrome\nautoimmune thyroiditis\nSteroid-responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis\nReninoma\nautoimmune myelofibrosis\nParathyroidAdenoma\nPrimary generalized epilepsy\nMalakoplakia\nFactor XIIII deficiency\npulmonary cryptococcosis\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\nFirst bite syndrome\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nruptured hepatic metastases\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\nnodular fasciitis\nlichen spinulosus\nNonfunctioningPituitaryMacroadenoma\nDrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nDistal renal tubular acidosis\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\nTIPIC syndrome\nhyperlipemic abdominal crisis\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\nTakayasu arteritis\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nHistiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nAorticValveFenestrationRupture\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nAmyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\nEsophageal rupture\nPericardialanisakiasis\nGadolinium-induced acute pancreatitis\npembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis\nPulmonary embolism\nTakayasu arteritis\nMalignant granular cell tumor\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\nJapanese encephalitis\nTakayasu arteritis\nneuronal intranuclear inclusion disease\nscurvy\nTIPIC syndrome\nLung adenocarcinoma\nancient schwannoma\nPulmonary embolism\nSclerosing meningioma\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nsarcoidosis\neosinophilic colitis\nneuronal intranuclear inclusion disease\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nautoimmune thyroiditis\nColistin neurotoxicity\nRhD alloimmunization\nmetastatic retinoblastoma\nlympho plasmacytoma\nEndogenous Candida endophthalmitis\nMalakoplakia\nGranular cell tumor\nwound botulism\nNeurofibroma\nbullous fixed drug eruption\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nLow-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma\nRosai\u2013Dorfman disease\nbiliary pancreatitis\nUnilateral absence of a pulmonary artery\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nOxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia\nparaneoplastic leukemoid reaction\nMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nPseudotumor deltoideus\nsyphilis\ngraft rejection\n",

Imaging repeatedly lacked findings typical of necrotizing enterocolitis (no pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or perforation) and malrotation was excluded. Laboratory data showed marked leukocytosis with significant eosinophilia, and there is a strong atopic/food-protein intolerance family history (sibling with milk-protein intolerance and hematochezia after milk exposure). CT demonstrated rectosigmoid mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel-wall thickening, consistent with distal colitis. This constellation (hematochezia in a neonate after milk exposure, eosinophilia, rectosigmoid-predominant colitis, and absence of NEC features) most strongly supports eosinophilic colitis.",

On examination, a palpable mass was noted in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Contrast-enhanced CT showed an enlarged right kidney (20\u00d715 cm) with hydronephrosis, nodular thickening of the pelvic lining, and enlarged hilar lymph nodes; multiple renal stones were also present. The findings were suggestive of urothelial carcinoma with lymph-node metastasis. There was no history of other neoplastic disease or prior hormonal treatment. The patient underwent right nephroureterectomy; residual matted lymph nodes with aortic encasement were left in situ. \n\nOn gross examination, the kidney was cystically dilated, and the pelvicalyceal surface was almost entirely replaced by pale-tan papillary and solid nodules up to 2.5 cm in diameter, with only a thin rim of renal parenchyma remaining. The ureter was uninvolved. \n\nMicroscopically, the tumor showed complex papillary structures lined by neoplastic cells with clear cytoplasm, large round nuclei with distinct nucleoli, and frequent hobnail morphology. Papillary cores contained variable stroma with hyaline basement membrane\u2013like material, and psammoma bodies were present focally. The tumor invaded into atrophic renal parenchyma and peripelvic fat. The entire pelvicalyceal surface was lined by these clear and hobnail cells. No invasive or in situ component of conventional urothelial carcinoma or non\u2013clear cell adenocarcinoma was identified, and no benign M\u00fcllerian-type epithelium was seen. \n\nImmunohistochemical studies showed tumor-cell positivity for cytokeratin 7, HNF-1\u03b2, and PAX8, with focal CA-125 expression; stains for RCC marker antigen, CD10, uroplakin III, p63, and CK20 were negative.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nVanishing white matter disease\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nDiaphragmatic amyloidosis\nSarcoidosis\nAdenocarcinoma of the lesser omentum\nMyofibrillar myopathy\nUrticarialFixedDrugEruption\nbiliary foreign body\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nClearCellAdenocarcinoma\nFamilial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification\nParaneoplastic cholestasis\nYaoSyndrome\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\nUnicystic ameloblastoma\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nBardet\u2010Biedl syndrome\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nCorticosteroid-induced liver injury\nRheumatoid nodules\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus\nAdult onset Still's disease\nadult-onset Still disease\nBasal cell nevus syndrome\nHemicrania continua\nadrenal hemorrhage\nHyperhomocysteinemia\nWernicke encephalopathy\nOxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia\nepithelioid trophoblastic tumor\ndissociative_conversion_disorder_unspecified\nHereditary spherocytosis\nCardiac sarcoidosis\nKapur-Toriello syndrome\nGradenigo syndrome\nepinephrine toxicity\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nEosinophilic myocarditis\nCervical carcinoma\nLower oesophageal stricture\nGerm cell tumor\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\nMicronodular thymic carcinoma with lymphoid hyperplasia\nMycosis fungoides\nintravenous leiomyomatosis\nMorgellons disease\nAmeloblasticFibroma\nPseudotail\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nopioid-induced catatonia\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nFemale adnexal tumor of probable Wolffian origin\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nCryptococcoma\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\nIgG4-related focal retroperitoneal fibrosis\nFactor VIII and XI deficiency\nmyocardial infarction\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nSertoli-Leydig cell tumor\nlympho plasmacytoma\nTall cell carcinoma of the breast with reversed polarity\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nvanishing bone disease\nKawasaki disease\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\nLymphocytic myocarditis\nLinearAtrophodermaOfMoulin\nAmyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\nMalignant melanoma\nKnobloch syndrome\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nancient schwannoma\nJapanese encephalitis\nseptic myocardial dysfunction\nWilson's disease\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nMemantine overdose\nTIPIC syndrome\nOvarian torsion\nWernicke encephalopathy\nEctopic liver tissue\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nsarcoidosis\nGadolinium-induced acute pancreatitis\nWarburg micro syndrome\nkeratoacanthoma\nMycosis fungoides\nsporotrichosis\nSMART syndrome\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nAndersen\u2013Tawil syndrome\nVagal paraganglioma\nPseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nossifying fibromyxoid tumor\nHashimotos thyroiditis\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\n",

He was alert and oriented. Cranial-nerve examination showed bilateral facial paralysis; pupils were 3 mm and reactive bilaterally. There was no sensory level. Muscle strength was 2/5 in all four limbs, reflexes were preserved, and plantar responses were extensor. \n\nLaboratory studies showed hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL, WBC 11,600/\u00b5L, platelets 305,000/mm3, PT 17.5 s, PTT 37.2 s, INR 1.27, ESR 23 mm/hr, negative CRP, and normal chemistry. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed 2 WBCs, 32 RBCs, protein 56 mg/dL, glucose 97 mg/dL (serum glucose 159 mg/dL), and no oligoclonal bands. Chest radiography and ECG were unremarkable.\n\nOn hospital day 2, brain MRI revealed poorly marginated T2-FLAIR hyperintense foci in the left cerebral peduncle, bilateral pons, and medulla with slight T1 hypointensity and faint contrast enhancement. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed restricted diffusion in the pons. MR spectroscopy showed elevated choline and myoinositol peaks.

He had lost 13 kg in the month before diagnosis and, following diagnosis, developed severe depression with anorexia, losing a further 23 kg (BMI 14.5) over four months. He received chemotherapy from April to August and had a partial response. Three weeks after his last cycle, he was admitted with a three-day history of confusion; his capillary glucose was 1.9 mmol/L, and he received intravenous dextrose until normoglycaemia. He had no history of alcohol use. Initial labs showed WBC 11.9\u00d710^9/L (neutrophils 10.9\u00d710^9/L); chest X-ray, urine studies, blood cultures, and stool cultures were unremarkable. Head CT showed no acute intracranial abnormality. Over the next four days, his confusion resolved with IV dextrose, nutritional supplements, and antibiotics. On hospital day 6, he acutely worsened with new-onset confusion accompanied by ataxia, agitation, and visual hallucinations. Over the following three days, he became withdrawn and drowsy, developed episodes of hypothermia, and remained normoglycaemic; repeat infectious work-up was negative. Laboratory studies at that time showed serum magnesium 0.34 mmol/L and serum folate 3.5 ng/mL.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nsclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma\npulmonary artery vasculitis\nIntermittent hydronephrosis\nToxoplasmosis\npostoperative granuloma\nAorticValveFenestrationRupture\nYaoSyndrome\nStarvation-induced liver enzyme elevation\njuvenile granulosa cell tumor\nGranular cell tumor\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nPanton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nCardiac angiosarcoma\nEntamoeba histolytica\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus\u2013positive mucocutaneous ulcer\ntuberculosis\nRosai-Dorfman disease\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nNon-pancreatic pseudocyst\nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis\nHyperplastic parathyroid gland seeding\ntuberculosis\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus infection\nMyxoma\nthymoma\nacute interstitial nephritis\nRhD alloimmunization\nToxic anterior segment syndrome\nX-linked hypophosphatemia\nhypothyroidism\ndrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nMoyamoya disease\nMycobacterium marinum infection\nHypertrophic osteoarthropathy\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\nIntracardiac metastasis\nintimal sarcoma\nCOVID toes\nlymphangioma\nBreast carcinoma\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nrenal arteriovenous malformation\nintravenous leiomyomatosis\ncow\u2019s milk protein allergy\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nAnaplasmosis\nBinswanger disease\nFactor XIIII deficiency\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nCalyceal rupture\nadrenal hemorrhage\nMalignant granular cell tumor\nCOVID-19 myocarditis\ndrug-induced interstitial lung disease\neosinophilic myocarditis\nMenetrier disease\nSLE myocarditis\nAreca nut toxicity\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\nPeripheralUlcerativeKeratitis\nSubependymoma\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nosteoma cutis\nrheumatoid meningitis\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\npembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis\nDrugInducedLupusErythematosus\nDuodromic tachycardia\nAdult onset Still's disease\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\ntenosynovial giant cell tumor\nbullous fixed drug eruption\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nParaganglioma\nCardiac amyloidosis\nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia\nPEComa\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nlymphangioma\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nmucormycosis\nHirayama disease\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\ntuberculous mediastinal abscess\nbilateral acute depigmentation of iris\nRosaiDorfmanDisease\nFactor VIII and XI deficiency\nBreast carcinoma\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\nbiliary pancreatitis\nthyroid adenocarcinoma\nScrub typhus\n",

He was afebrile, mildly tachycardic, and normotensive. On examination, breath sounds were decreased bilaterally and pulse oximetry showed an SpO2 of 90% on room air. Supplemental oxygen was started, and chest CT revealed a simultaneous bilateral pneumothorax that was larger on the left side. In addition, there were numerous elliptically shaped lung cysts of various sizes distributed bilaterally, predominantly in the basilar medial, basilar lateral, and subpleural regions. Bilateral chest tubes were placed, resulting in full reexpansion of both lungs with no persistent air leak after 48 hours. Radiographic findings suggested an underlying multiple cystic lung disease.

She was born at 37 weeks\u2019 gestation to consanguineous parents by uncomplicated vaginal delivery (birth weight 3 kg). At 6 days of age, she developed poor feeding, lethargy, and frequent vomiting. In the emergency department, she was severely dehydrated with an arterial pH of 7.20, serum bicarbonate 11 mmol/L, serum potassium 10 mmol/L, and serum sodium 119 mmol/L. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was required, and she was intubated. Initial hormonal studies were obtained, and she received hydrocortisone (stress dose), a fluid bolus, sodium bicarbonate, and measures to lower potassium. She was admitted to the neonatal ICU, tested negative for sepsis and metabolic disorders, and was discharged on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone without sodium supplementation.  \n\nAt 20 days of age, she was readmitted with recurrent vomiting, poor feeding, and lethargy, again with hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Treatment included hydrocortisone, fluid resuscitation, sodium bicarbonate, potassium\u2010lowering measures, and emergency peritoneal dialysis.  \n\nUpon transfer at 41 days, she was alert, well hydrated, with normal female genitalia and no dysmorphism. Vital signs were stable. Laboratory studies showed sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 5 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 23 mmol/L; urinalysis and urine culture were normal. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was negative for SRY, and karyotype was 46,XX. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography were normal. Repeat hormonal studies were inconsistent with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and she did not respond adequately to corticosteroids, requiring ongoing mineralocorticoid therapy.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nmembranous glomerulonephritis\nSMARCA4-DTS\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\ncryptogenic embolic stroke\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\ncardioinhibitory reflex syncope\nhypothyroidism\nRasmussen's encephalitis\nPost-traumatic facial hematoma\nGastric submucosal arterial collaterals\nnegative pressure pulmonary hemorrhage\nGliomatosis cerebri\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nidiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins\nOculomotor mononeuropathy\nHypokalemic paralysis\nacquired hemophilia\nSMARCA4-DTS\nCanalis sinuosus nerve injury\ncysticercosis\nKaposi sarcoma\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nseptic myocardial dysfunction\nNeuro-Behcet\u2019s disease\nAcquired hemophilia A\nsmall cell lung cancer\nAnomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\nRetrograde contrast reflux into the duodenum\nEmphysematous cystitis\nAdultOnsetStillsDisease\nabdominal migraine\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nOvarian torsion\nRetinal neovascularization\nnodular fasciitis\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nlaryngeal tuberculosis\nautoimmune thyroiditis\nAdenocarcinoma of the lesser omentum\nancient schwannoma\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nSecondary syphilis\nIdiopathic carotidynia\nHemicrania continua\nCaecal adenocarcinoma\nMOGHE\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nPPP syndrome\nCardiac myxoma\nextranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\ncryptogenic embolic stroke\nSubependymoma\nLuschka duct cyst\nEosinophilic myocarditis\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nListeria rhombencephalitis\nautoimmune thyroiditis\nJapanese encephalitis\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nembryonal rhabdomyosarcoma\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nlympho plasmacytoma\nmelorheostosis\nPrimary aldosteronism\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nvaricella zoster virus encephalitis\nConstrictive pericarditis\nSarcoidosis\nDisseminated tuberculosis\nPannus formation\nRetrograde contrast reflux into the duodenum\nFunctionalNeurologicalDisorder\nGastric submucosal arterial collaterals\nLaugier-Hunziker syndrome\nHypertrophic osteoarthropathy\nmembranous glomerulonephritis\nFolateDeficientOpticNeuropathy\nprostatic utricle\ncaseous mitral annular calcification\nneuronal intranuclear inclusion disease\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nBurkittLymphoma\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nHerpes simplex virus 1 encephalitis\nAcquired hemophilia A\nClearCellAdenocarcinoma\nneuronal intranuclear inclusion disease\nepinephrine toxicity\nsubpleural pulmonary cysts\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\nmeningoencephalocele\nMefloquine toxicity\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus\n",

She denied fever or vomiting. She had used NSAIDs for the past week for lower-limb discomfort. Her history included recent treatment for pneumonia, progressive exertional dyspnea over 1 year without functional limitation, an asymptomatic cardiac murmur diagnosed 11 years earlier, appendectomy, hysterectomy, and a 90 pack-year smoking history.\n\nOn examination, she was afebrile, pale, and hemodynamically stable without peripheral edema. Lung auscultation was clear. Cardiac exam revealed a systolic ejection murmur best heard in the aortic area. Abdominal examination showed a flat but mildly tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds and no peritoneal signs.\n\nLaboratory tests showed creatinine 7.6 mg/dL (0.4\u20131.3), urea 191 mg/dL (10\u201350), hemoglobin 8 g/dL, hematocrit 27%, and an iron profile consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. Potassium was 5.6 mEq/L; other electrolytes and pH were normal. Urinalysis revealed hematuria and 24-hour proteinuria of 689 mg. Renal ultrasound demonstrated normal kidney size with parenchymal thickening.\n\nEchocardiography showed left atrial enlargement (47 mm), left ventricular ejection fraction 62%, septal thickness 17 mm, posterior wall thickness 14 mm, inferolateral hypokinesia, and a calcified aortic valve with severe stenosis (peak gradient 92 mmHg).\n\nShe was treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for presumed NSAID-induced acute interstitial nephritis and severe aortic stenosis but did not improve and required hemodialysis. A renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis with medullary lymphomonocytic infiltration; of five glomeruli, four were sclerotic. ANA and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA were negative; complement levels were normal. Serologies for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. p-ANCA was positive at >\u200a1\u200a/\u200a80 (nonreactive normal), and myeloperoxidase antibody was 120 U (normal <\u200a20).\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nRelationship disappointment stress syndrome\nlymphangioma\nFibrous meningioma\nStarvation-induced liver enzyme elevation\nMoyamoya disease\nPituitary abscess\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nMultilocularThymicCyst\nMiller Fisher syndrome\nMiller Fisher syndrome\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma\nMyofibrillar myopathy\nExtensive macular atrophy with pseudodrusen\nCorticosteroid-induced liver injury\nNeuroborreliosis\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\nscleredema adultorum of Buschke\nMarginal keratitis\nmucormycosis\ncysticercosis\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\nplasmablastic myeloma\nDiabetic myonecrosis\nHemorrhagic pericardial effusion from blunt chest trauma\nAcute hematogenous osteomyelitis\nDiaphragmatic amyloidosis\nPituitary abscess\nOrnithineTranscarbamylaseDeficiency\nBecker muscular dystrophy\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\nMyocarditis\nPericardialanisakiasis\nwound botulism\nMoyamoya disease\nlorlatinib toxicity\nmicroscopic polyangiitis\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\nGitelman's syndrome\ndissociative_conversion_disorder_unspecified\nMembranous aplasia cutis congenita\nOsteoidOsteoma\ncentral serous chorioretinopathy\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nErosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp\nMacrophageActivationSyndrome\nMyopericarditis\nkeratoacanthoma\nPrimary testicular lymphoma\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nPseudothrombotic microangiopathy\nMeropenem-induced thrombocytopenia\nIgG4-related disease\nintravenous leiomyomatosis\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nDentigerous cyst\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nTINU syndrome\nhypothyroidism\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\nFemale adnexal tumor of probable Wolffian origin\nToxoplasmosis\nHyperhomocysteinemia\nleft atrial thrombus\nMyopericarditis\nacquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nPeritoneal tuberculosis\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nMorgellons disease\nlymphangitis carcinomatosa\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma\ntight filum terminale\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome\nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\nintimal sarcoma\nTropheryma whipplei endocarditis\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\nChronicExertionalCompartmentSyndrome\nIgA-dominant MPGN\ncentral diabetes insipidus\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis\ndeep soft tissue leiomyoma\nSpontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nIntraosseous meningioma\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\ncutaneous leishmaniasis\nParaganglioma\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\nChronicExertionalCompartmentSyndrome\nsarcoidosis\nExtensive macular atrophy with pseudodrusen\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nIntracardiac metastasis\n",

The pain began as generalized cramping and later localized to the epigastrium without radiation; there were no alleviating or aggravating factors. She denied dysphagia, odynophagia, fever, chills, rashes, joint pains, recent travel, sick contacts, or antibiotic use. She had been admitted twice previously for similar symptoms; a prior CT scan showed fluid\u2010filled bowels and colonic wall thickening, and she received empirical antibiotics without improvement.\n\nOn examination, she appeared uncomfortable. Blood pressure was 146/93 mmHg, pulse 88/min, temperature 36.5 \u00b0C. The abdomen was tender, worst in the epigastrium, without rebound or distention; bowel sounds were normal, and there was no organomegaly. Other systems were unremarkable except for xanthelasmas on the eyelids.\n\nLaboratory studies showed a WBC count of 9,000/\u00b5L with 28% eosinophils (absolute count 2520/\u00b5L). Hemoglobin was 14.7 g/dL. Lipase was 2831 IU/L (previously 2415 IU/L five days earlier). Alkaline phosphatase was 391 IU/L, AST 57 U/L, ALT 54 U/L; bilirubin, kidney function, lactate, and electrolytes were normal. ESR was 10 mm/h and CRP 0.673 mg/dL. Peripheral smear demonstrated mature\u2010appearing eosinophils without atypia. HIV test was negative; IgG4 was 40 mg/dL (normal <86). Chest X-ray showed no infiltrates or adenopathy.\n\nStool PCR panel was negative for bacterial and viral pathogens; ova and parasites were negative. Review of her medications excluded drug-induced eosinophilia. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed diffuse fluid-filled loops of small and large bowel without obstruction; the pancreas appeared normal.\n\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies from the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and jejunum was performed. Histologic examination revealed eosinophilic-predominant mucosal inflammatory infiltrates in all specimens. Helicobacter pylori testing was negative. No villous abnormality, cryptitis, or crypt abscesses were identified.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nVanishing white matter disease\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\nVaricella zoster virus infection\nPseudotumor deltoideus\nAndersen\u2013Tawil syndrome\nepinephrine toxicity\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nToxoplasmosis\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nUreteral stone\nMucosal neuroma syndrome\nPEComa\nsyphilis\nMorphea\nSMART syndrome\nhyperinsulinaemic reactive hypoglycemia\nMyocarditis\nMOGHE\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\nAcute hematogenous osteomyelitis\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\nChronic compartment syndrome\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nBalo concentric sclerosis\nmiliary tuberculosis\nClearCellAdenocarcinoma\nposterior elbow impingement\nDuodromic tachycardia\nPPP syndrome\nwell-differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nMycosis fungoides\nEagle\u2019s syndrome\nMulticentric reticulohistiocytosis\nEnamel hypoplasia\nPseudotail\nOdontogenic cutaneous sinus tract\nStreptococcus salivarius pneumonia\nParaganglioma\nSarcoidosis\nB-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia\nSerotonin syndrome\nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nHypereosinophilic syndrome\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nPrimary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease\nSMART syndrome\nDuodromic tachycardia\nMeningioma\nSchnitzler syndrome\nMDMA toxicity\nHemicrania continua\nSteroid-responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis\nNeonatal severe hyperparathyroidism\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\nkeratoacanthoma\nPituitary abscess\nChronic compartment syndrome\nPrimary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease\nSchnitzler syndrome\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\norganized thrombus\nepinephrine toxicity\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nrenal artery aneurysm\nRetinal neovascularization\ngraft rejection\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nMycobacterium haemophilum\nMeningioma\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nacquired hemophilia\nCaecal adenocarcinoma\nScleroderma_renal_crisis\nHistiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma\nRelapsing polychondritis\nNeurofibroma\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor\nMethanol toxicity\nPEComa\nAcute myeloid leukemia\nHypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nconjunctival cyst\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nParasitic leiomyoma\nLeiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminate\ntight filum terminale\nPanton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia\nMenetrier disease\nPrimary aldosteronism\nAbusive abdominal trauma\nUrticarialFixedDrugEruption\n",

She had no dysphagia, odynophagia, dysphonia, weight loss, or appetite change. On examination, there was a smooth, nonfluctuant, non-tethered 6-mm level IV lymph node. Routine blood tests, including complete blood count, liver and renal function, were normal; carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated at 24.0 mg/L (normal <2.5 mg/L). Ultrasound of the lump showed a 6-mm level IV cervical lymph node with intranodal calcifications, loss of hilar architecture, and increased vascularity. Fine-needle aspiration cytology demonstrated clusters of atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and moderate cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cell block preparation showed cells positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and CDX2. Whole-body PET-CT revealed elevated tracer uptake in an 8.4-mm left level IV node and a 7-mm left supraclavicular node, with no further evidence of thoracic or abdominal disease.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nProstate adenocarcinoma\nNonspecific interstitial pneumonia\nFat embolism syndrome\nautoimmune thyroiditis\nParavalvular leakage\nPrimary empty sella syndrome\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nxanthoma disseminatum\nTakotsubo syndrome\ngerminoma\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nNoonan syndrome\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\nHyperhomocysteinemia\nCardiac amyloidosis\nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia\nHyperplastic parathyroid gland seeding\nTropheryma whipplei endocarditis\nHepatocellularcarcinomawithbiliaryandneuroendocrinedifferentiation\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\nSecondary syphilis\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis\njuvenile granulosa cell tumor\nintravascular large B-cell lymphoma\nIntracardiac metastasis\nParaneoplastic morphea\nNeonatal severe hyperparathyroidism\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nChronic compartment syndrome\nNonurachal adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder\nCerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nMDMA toxicity\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\nbiliary pancreatitis\nJapanese encephalitis\nintravascular large B-cell lymphoma\nLeiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminate\nOral focal mucinosis\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\ncerebral granulomatosis\ncryptogenic embolic stroke\nExogenous androgen exposure\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nBardet\u2010Biedl syndrome\nUpper septal fascicular ventricular tachycardia\nDRESS syndrome\ncongenital pseudoarthrosis of the medial malleolus\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nadult-onset Still disease\nNoonan syndrome\nExtranodal marginal zone lymphoma\nDistal renal tubular acidosis\nMyxoma\nListeria rhombencephalitis\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\nNitrofurantoin-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nExogenous androgen exposure\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\nLucio phenomenon\nWarburg micro syndrome\nMethanol toxicity\nEmphysematous cystitis\nSchnitzler syndrome\nPericardialanisakiasis\neosinophilic colitis\nshiitake dermatitis\nautosensitization reaction\nSerpentine-like syndrome\nosteoma cutis\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis\nK\u00fcttner's tumor\nChronicExertionalCompartmentSyndrome\nlorlatinib toxicity\nMalignant granular cell tumor\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma\nsporotrichosis\nEnamel hypoplasia\nCaecal adenocarcinoma\nTumid lupus erythematosus\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nPostoperative inflammation\nSebaceous carcinoma\nFibroma\nLarge vessel vasculitis\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nlymphangitis carcinomatosa\nBirt-Hogg-Dub\u00e8 syndrome\nPericardialanisakiasis\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nacute cerebellitis\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nBehcet disease\nscurvy\n",

In 2018, he had right facial paralysis that resolved with corticosteroids; two years later, he noted numbness of the left face and neck. In February 2022, he developed persistent pain and numbness in his right hand, and by June 2022 he was unable to raise his right arm. He was initially treated with two courses of intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily for three days) and one course of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg daily), without improvement. The weakness progressed, and his right facial paralysis recurred, prompting referral in July 2022.\n\nOn examination, he had right facial paralysis and diffuse right upper limb weakness (Medical Research Council grade 0\u20131/5) with severe muscle atrophy and areflexia from C5 to T1 distributions. There was severe dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the right upper limb and mild dysesthesia in the left face and anterior neck. Vitals were normal.\n\nBlood tests showed negative vasculitis-associated immune markers, including antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and an elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor level (1,198 U/mL). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed 14 cells/\u03bcL and a normal protein level.\n\nConventional nerve conduction studies demonstrated absent compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials in the right median and ulnar nerves, with markedly reduced amplitude in the right axillary nerve; studies in the lower limbs were normal. The pattern indicated axonal degeneration involving postganglionic segments.\n\nNerve ultrasound (18 MHz) of the right median nerve at the forearm showed marked enlargement (cross-sectional area, 54 mm\u00b2) with swollen fascicles and perineurium, and a fusiform hypoechoic mass between the nerve and thickened epineurium. The right ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves also showed segmental enlargement with loss of the normal fascicular pattern. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed massive enlargement and increased vascularity of the right brachial plexus and cervical nerve roots. Subsequent MRI confirmed massive swelling of the right median nerve, nerve roots, and brachial plexus. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT demonstrated abnormal FDG uptake in these same structures, suggesting neurolymphomatosis.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nRheumatoid nodules\nMalignant melanoma\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nRosai-Dorfman disease\nCorticosteroid-induced liver injury\nFirst bite syndrome\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\nLipoma\nfunctional dysphagia\nbullous fixed drug eruption\nlorlatinib toxicity\nKapur-Toriello syndrome\nOrnithineTranscarbamylaseDeficiency\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\nExogenous androgen exposure\nneurolymphomatosis\nAcinic cell carcinoma\nbullous fixed drug eruption\nNonrheumatic myocarditis\nDRESS syndrome\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\nOsteoidOsteoma\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis\ntumor-induced osteomalacia\nMalignant granular cell tumor\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\nRenalArteryOcclusion\nrenal artery aneurysm\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nGranulocytic sarcoma\nRhabdomyolysis\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\nleprosy\nPoncet\u2019s disease\nCorticosteroid-induced liver injury\nruptured hepatic metastases\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nGenital herpes\nsebaceous carcinoma\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nembryonal rhabdomyosarcoma\nNeuroendocrine tumor\nmiliary tuberculosis\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\ndiabetic polyradiculopathy\nMycosis fungoides\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nnodular pulmonary amyloidosis\ncysticercosis\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nautoimmune myelofibrosis\nPrimary hepatic lymphoma\nwell-differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nGallbladderVolvulus\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nToxic anterior segment syndrome\nstress cardiomyopathy\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nsuperior orbital fissure syndrome\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nmetastatic retinoblastoma\nacquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nOrbital myositis\nSchnitzler syndrome\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nwell-differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nautoimmune myelofibrosis\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\ngiant cell arteritis\nHereditary spherocytosis\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\ngraft rejection\nParaganglioma\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nErosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp\ntight filum terminale\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\nPertussis\nCanalis sinuosus nerve injury\nIntraosseous meningioma\nsingle-organ vasculitis\n",

His history included allergic rhinitis; he smoked 5\u201310 cigarettes per day and drank socially. Three months earlier, he had sexual intercourse with a commercial sex worker; he had not traveled abroad. \n\nHe denied fever, cough, sputum production, or weight loss. A local plain CT scan performed three weeks earlier showed multiple nodular shadows in the left lower lobe, and metastatic lung cancer was suspected. Contrast-enhanced thoracic CT one week later again showed multiple nodular shadows in the left lower lobe, slight enlargement of left mediastinal and bilateral axillary lymph nodes, and a small left pleural effusion; upper and lower endoscopy were normal. He was referred for further evaluation.\n\nOn arrival, temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, pulse 85/min, blood pressure 102/60 mmHg, and SpO2 99% on room air. Examination revealed several millimeter oral aphthae, numerous soft, non-tender cervical lymph nodes bilaterally, and multiple pale red, scaly, nodular erythematous patches 3\u20138 mm in size on the palms and soles. Heart and lung examinations were unremarkable.\n\nLaboratory studies showed a white blood cell count of 10,600/\u03bcL, platelet count of 621,000/\u03bcL, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase of 161 U/L, C-reactive protein of 3.13 mg/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 62 mm/h, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor of 1180 U/mL. Tests for HIV antigen/antibody, hepatitis B and C, HTLV-1 antibody, and tumor markers (CEA, SCC, CYFRA, Pro-GRP, NSE) were negative. \u03b2-D glucan, rheumatoid factor, MPO-ANCA, and PR3-ANCA were all negative.\n\nChest radiography showed blunting of the left costophrenic angle without discrete lung field opacities. Doppler ultrasonography of the neck confirmed multiple enlarged lymph nodes with preserved hila. PET-CT demonstrated high uptake in bilateral cervical, subclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, and pelvic lymph nodes but no abnormal uptake elsewhere.\n\nCervical lymph node biopsy revealed lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, enlarged germinal centers, paracortical dilation, vascular proliferation, and fibrosis. Bacterial and acid-fast bacillus smears and cultures were negative, as was PCR for Mycobacterium DNA. Immunostaining of germinal centers was negative for B-cell lymphoma, and flow cytometry and genetic studies supported reactive lymphadenopathy.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\nCavernous hemangioma\nnodular fasciitis\ncruciate paralysis\nthymoma\nSinusoidal obstruction syndrome\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nReel syndrome\nLarge vessel vasculitis\nCervical carcinoma\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\nrheumatoid meningitis\ntoxin-induced leukoencephalopathy\nANCA-associated vasculitis\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\ncemento-ossifying fibroma\npulmonary bulla\nmyocardial infarction\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\nosteoma cutis\nMalignant melanoma\nPrimary syphilis\nTIPIC syndrome\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nsyphilis\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nPrimary generalized epilepsy\nWernicke encephalopathy\nMidventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nFactor VIII and XI deficiency\nMethotrexate pneumonitis\npulmonary artery vasculitis\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\nTubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nToxoplasmosis\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\ntoxin-induced leukoencephalopathy\nGCSFAortitis\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nB-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nRheumatoid nodules\neosinophilic colitis\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nIntestinal tuberculosis\nshiitake dermatitis\nChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nMorphea\nLeptospirosis\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nCardiac sarcoidosis\nPeritoneal tuberculosis\nSecondary syphilis\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus\nPituitary abscess\nCardiac myxoma\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\npseudoprogression\ngeneralized lymphangiomatosis\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nneuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus\ngeneralized lymphangiomatosis\nmidbrain infarction\nAtypical hemolytic uremic syndrome\nfunctional dysphagia\nSubependymoma\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nMyopericarditis\nAzathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome\nAtypical mastocytoma\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nGerminoma\nmalignant catatonia\nAcute myeloid leukemia\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nAnaphylaxis\npostoperative granuloma\nReel syndrome\nFunctionalNeurologicalDisorder\nMahaim pathway tachycardia due to triggered activity\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\ndecompression retinopathy\nruptured hepatic metastases\nGaucher disease type 3C\nSMARCA4-DTS\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nMulticentric reticulohistiocytosis\nnodular pulmonary amyloidosis\nMirizzi syndrome\nHerpes simplex virus 1 encephalitis\nAdult onset Still's disease\n",

Initial excisional biopsy showed changes suggestive but not diagnostic of Castleman\u2019s disease. A CT scan revealed an 8\u00d76\u2009cm colliquative mass in the left axillary and supraclavicular regions, smaller reactive nodes in the right axilla and inguinal areas, and subcentimeter nodules in the lung and liver. Repeat lymph node biopsies through 2010 demonstrated nonspecific necrotizing lymphadenitis; microbiologic and virologic studies, including HHV-6 and HHV-8, were negative. A subsequent CT scan confirmed persistent axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, bilateral inguinal enlargement, and a perianal mass. Review of prior histology noted necrotizing lymphadenitis with epithelioid and giant cells and vasculitis without lymphoproliferation.  \n\nIn January 2011, rheumatologic evaluation revealed nasal chondritis with crusted lesions, chronic conjunctivitis, violaceous purpuric areas on the extremities, ulcerative palmar and gluteal lesions, and persistent evening fevers. Examination showed mobile, nontender axillary and inguinal nodes. Nasal mucosal biopsy demonstrated acute and chronic inflammation but no vasculitis or granulomas. Laboratory studies revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated acute-phase reactants.

Influenza A/B tests were negative; he received amoxicillin and ibuprofen without improvement. \n\nOn day 6, he was alert with temperature 38.5 \u00b0C, heart rate 88 bpm, blood pressure 133/69 mmHg, neck stiffness, positive Kernig sign at 60\u00b0, and tender bilateral cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. White blood cell count was 8200/mm3 (6.0% eosinophils). Serum creatinine was 0.91 mg/dL; BUN 6.0 mg/dL. ESR was 55 mm/hr; CRP 11.58 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed no protein or cells. Head CT was normal. CSF opening pressure was 235 mmH2O; CSF had 1 cell/\u00b5L, glucose 66 mg/dL, protein 31 mg/dL; Gram stain and cultures of CSF and blood were negative. Oral levofloxacin was started.\n\nDespite CRP falling to 0.67 mg/dL by day 17, creatinine rose to 2.74 mg/dL and peripheral eosinophils reached 12.5%. Levofloxacin and esomeprazole were stopped on day 17. He was transferred on day 20 with creatinine 2.09 mg/dL, urinary \u03b22-microglobulin 1589 \u00b5g/L, N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase 7.9 IU/L, and FeNa 2.1%. Renal sonography was unremarkable.\n\nRenal biopsy on day 22 showed focal interstitial edema, mononuclear and eosinophilic infiltrates, mild tubulitis, and four noncaseating granulomas; glomeruli and vessels were preserved. Immunofluorescence was negative. Acid-fast and Grocott stains were negative. ACE level was normal. Chest X-ray and CT were normal; gallium scan showed no uptake. Autoantibodies including ANA, ANCA (MPO and PR3), anti-SS-A/SS-B, anti-dsDNA, and anti-GBM were negative; viral serologies (HIV, hepatitis, EBV, CMV, mumps) were not consistent with acute infection.\n\nOn day 29, he developed bilateral eye pain, conjunctival hyperemia, photophobia, and blurred vision.

The pain was exacerbated by right arm movement. She denied trauma or travel.\n\nHer medications included pembrolizumab and recent head and neck radiation. She had a 1.5-year smoking history (0.5 pack per day), social alcohol use, and no significant family history of cancer aside from a grandmother with brain cancer.\n\nOn examination, she appeared frail with weight loss. Vital signs: heart rate 86 bpm; blood pressure 121/74 mm\u2009Hg. Pulmonary auscultation revealed coarse rales and rhonchi in the left lower lung field. Cardiac examination showed a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

On examination, there was tenderness in the left lower abdomen without peritoneal signs and no Murphy sign. Laboratory studies, including inflammatory markers, liver function tests, and biliary enzymes, were all within normal limits. \nA contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen at admission showed an enlarged gallbladder with wall thickening but no gallstones, along with prominent small-bowel gas, mild intestinal dilatation, and slight wall thickening. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed an enlarged, thick-walled gallbladder without stones. She was diagnosed with acute enterocolitis or subileus and managed conservatively with bowel rest and intravenous fluids.\nSix hours later, she developed sudden severe right upper quadrant pain and vomiting unresponsive to analgesics or antiemetics.

She was asymptomatic. On examination, there were no palpable masses in the breasts, axillae, or abdomen. Laboratory studies, including complete blood count and serum tumor markers (CEA 1.8 ng/mL, CA15-3 11.4 U/mL, BCA225 30.7 U/mL, NCC-ST-439 1.3 U/mL, soluble IL-2 receptor 322 U/mL), were all within normal limits.\n\nMammography revealed a high-density mass with clustered microcalcifications in the inferior lateral right breast. Chest CT confirmed a well-enhancing right breast mass without axillary lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology of the breast lesion yielded class V cells, consistent with malignancy.\n\nAs part of staging, abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with internal blood flow signals arising from the splenic periphery. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed a 40-mm well-circumscribed splenic lesion with less enhancement than the surrounding parenchyma in the arterial and portal phases, becoming isodense in the delayed phase. MRI of the abdomen revealed a lesion isointense to the spleen on T1- and T2-weighted images, with slow centripetal enhancement reaching parity with the spleen at 10 minutes post-contrast. PET-CT showed no significant FDG uptake in the splenic lesion.\n\nThe preoperative differential diagnoses for the splenic mass included benign vascular neoplasms (hemangioma, lymphangioma, littoral cell angioma, hamartoma, inflammatory pseudotumor), angiosarcoma, solitary splenic metastasis of breast cancer, and primary splenic lymphoma. Given the inability to establish a definitive diagnosis noninvasively, the decision was made to perform a partial mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy and a simultaneous laparoscopic splenectomy for therapeutic diagnosis.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\ngranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis\nMembranous aplasia cutis congenita\nstiff RA syndrome\nMefloquine toxicity\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\nLoeys-Dietz syndrome\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nSteroid-responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nProstate adenocarcinoma\nDentigerous cyst\nAdult onset Still's disease\nToxoplasmosis\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nMembranous aplasia cutis congenita\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nBrucellosis\nmixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumor\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nRosai\u2013Dorfman disease\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nEctopic liver tissue\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nPseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B\nparaneoplastic leukemoid reaction\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\ncaseous mitral annular calcification\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nFamilial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification\nCardiacSarcoidosis\nRosaiDorfmanDisease\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nHereditary hemochromatosis\nLarge vessel vasculitis\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nVaricella zoster virus infection\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nAcquired hemophilia A\nchemical abscess\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\nGitelman's syndrome\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\ndedifferentiated liposarcoma\nSpontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nMenetrier disease\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nMOGHE\nCandidiasis\nFat embolism syndrome\nacute interstitial nephritis\nmicrovascular angina\nSecondary syphilis\nopioid-induced catatonia\nAnaphylaxis\nJapanese encephalitis\nYaoSyndrome\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\nAdhesive small bowel obstruction\nExtranodal marginal zone lymphoma\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\nDiaphragmatic amyloidosis\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\nSinusoidal obstruction syndrome\nvertebral hemangioma\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nAortopulmonary artery fistula\ngranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis\nCardiacSarcoidosis\nToxoplasmosis\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus\nFemale adnexal tumor of probable Wolffian origin\nNeurosyphilis\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nmembranous glomerulonephritis\nendometrial stromal sarcoma\nRelationship disappointment stress syndrome\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nProstate adenocarcinoma\ncold agglutinin disease\nSclerosing meningioma\nSteroid-responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nCOVID-19 myocarditis\nnodular fasciitis\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nEosinophilic gastritis\nGiant tumefactive perivascular spaces\nPrimary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\n",

Physical examination showed mild distress, moist oral mucosa, and a nonfocal neurologic examination with normal pupils.\n\nIn the emergency department, her venous blood glucose was 15 mg/dL. She received two additional doses of dextrose 50% in water, improving her glucose to 45 mg/dL, followed by an infusion of dextrose 5% in water, which raised her glucose to 96 mg/dL.\n\nOnce stable and alert, she reported that the previous evening at 5 pm she took two light blue pills given by a friend for anxiety, believing they were diazepam. She felt unwell overnight with nausea and diaphoresis, awoke at 4 am with tremulousness, improved after a large lunch at 11 am, then used cocaine and consumed three beers before losing consciousness at dinner around 7 pm.\n\nHer history was notable for substance use disorder and anxiety. She denied personal or family history of diabetes or use of hypoglycemic medications. Current medications included methadone; she had no allergies. Social history included daily tobacco use and occasional beer consumption.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for benzodiazepines, ethanol, and cocaine. Laboratory studies revealed a blood glucose of 44 mg/dL, insulin level of 47.4 mIU/mL (normal 2.6\u201324.9), and C-peptide of 5.4 ng/mL (normal 1.1\u20134.4).

She reported exertional dyspnea (NYHA class II) and fatigue. Her history was notable for lichen planus dermatitis treated with immunosuppression several years earlier and TPO antibody\u2013positive hypothyroidism on levothyroxine. One month earlier, she had mild COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR, with no hypoxemia or pulmonary involvement, which resolved with outpatient therapy. Three weeks later, she developed severe chest discomfort and shortness of breath. ECG showed ST-segment elevations in leads V2\u2013V6 and troponin-I was elevated, but coronary angiography revealed normal epicardial arteries. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal LV size, apical hypokinesia, and an EF of 35\u201340%; RV size and function were normal. Cardiac MRI showed mildly enlarged LV size (LVEF 35%), a thin and aneurysmal apex, and widespread patchy subepicardial to mid-wall fibrosis in inferolateral and septal segments with subendocardial fibrosis at the apex; the report recommended evaluation for recent viral, autoimmune, or sarcoidosis-related myocarditis.\n\nOn exam in January, blood pressure was 115/75 mmHg, heart rate 90/min, oxygen saturation 96%, and bi-basilar crackles were present. Labs showed hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, normal renal and liver function, NT-proBNP 885 pg/mL, normal thyroid tests, and elevated anti-TPO. She was started on guideline-directed heart failure therapy. A few days later, she developed worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, abdominal pain, and nausea. On admission, blood pressure was 85/60 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, mild ascites, and 2+ pitting edema. Creatinine was 1.7 mg/dL, ALT 46 U/L, AST 40 U/L, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, NT-proBNP >18,000 pg/mL, and troponin-I remained elevated. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with low-voltage QRSs, Q waves in leads I, III, aVF, and V1\u2013V6, ST elevations, and T-wave inversions. Echocardiography revealed mild LV enlargement, EF 15\u201320%, global hypokinesia, apical akinesia, mild RV enlargement with severe dysfunction (TAPSE 10 mm, RV Sm 6 cm/s), moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, a plethoric IVC (23 mm), and TR gradient 25 mmHg.

Cardiac MRI demonstrated widespread patchy subepicardial-to-mid-wall fibrosis in multiple LV segments (a nonischemic inflammatory pattern) with apical involvement, and the report specifically recommended evaluation for recent viral/autoimmune/sarcoid myocarditis. The rapid deterioration with persistent troponin elevation and low-voltage/Q waves supports ongoing myocardial inflammation/injury rather than isolated functional valvular disease or coronary obstruction.

She reported several episodes over the past week of morning and evening confusion and tremulousness after fasting several hours; finger-stick glucometers confirmed values in the 30s and symptoms resolved with sugar-containing foods, fulfilling Whipple\u2019s triad. Metformin had been discontinued after hypoglycemia began. On admission, renal function was normal. Liver enzymes were stably elevated, with normal bilirubin, INR, and a mildly decreased albumin. During a hypoglycemic episode (glucose 33 mg/dL), laboratory evaluation showed insulin <1 \u03bcU/mL (reference 3\u201325), C-peptide <0.5 ng/mL (reference 1.1\u20134.3), \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate <1.0 mmol/L (reference <3), and random cortisol 23 \u03bcg/dL (reference morning 8\u201325). Thyroid studies showed TSH 8.3 mIU/L (reference 0.3\u20134.7) and free T4 0.80 ng/dL (reference 0.80\u20131.70), and her levothyroxine dose was increased. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was 15 ng/mL (reference 41\u2013279), and IGF-2 was 147 ng/mL (reference 180\u2013580), yielding an IGF-2:IGF-1 molar ratio of 10.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nintimal sarcoma\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma\nsarcoidosis\nMycobacterium haemophilum\nFactorXIIIdeficiency\nMulticentric reticulohistiocytosis\nPEComa\nsmall cell lung cancer\ngiant cell arteritis\nmalignant catatonia\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nCorticosteroid-induced liver injury\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\nWarburg micro syndrome\nmicroscopic polyangiitis\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\nIris stromal proliferation\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nLuschka duct cyst\nAdamantinoma\nRelationship disappointment stress syndrome\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nListeria rhombencephalitis\nuterine artery rupture\nSerotonin syndrome\nOvarian torsion\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nOdontogenic cutaneous sinus tract\nStrumaOvarii\nBrownTumor\nparaganglioma\nPachydermoperiostosis\nNonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia\nMyelinOligodendrocyteGlycoproteinAntibodyAssociatedTransverseMyelitis\nDiabetic myonecrosis\nvanishing bone disease\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nOvarianCancer\nCongenital anterolateral tibial bowing and polydactyly\nthyroid adenocarcinoma\nMefloquine toxicity\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\nflecainide pneumonitis\nSchnitzler syndrome\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nPericardialanisakiasis\nPOEMSSyndrome\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nPseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B\nBurkittLymphoma\nClear cell sarcoma\nRhabdomyolysis\nprostatic utricle\nEctopic liver tissue\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nnecrotizing autoimmune myopathy\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nMyopericarditis\nAbusive head trauma\nBurkittLymphoma\nQFever\nNon-pancreatic pseudocyst\nOrbital myositis\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nsulfonylurea poisoning\nGitelman's syndrome\nPEComa\nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\ncruciate paralysis\nSweet syndrome\nEnamel hypoplasia\nLuschka duct cyst\nLymphocytic myocarditis\nNon-pancreatic pseudocyst\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nRelationship disappointment stress syndrome\nsulfonylurea poisoning\nLeptospirosis\nNonrheumatic myocarditis\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nSubependymoma\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nkeratoacanthoma\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nSMARCA4-DTS\nIntestinal tuberculosis\nsarcoidosis\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nLeydig cell tumor of the ovary\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\ntransient brachial plexus block\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\n",

MRI revealed a 13 cm mass in the left posteroinferior thigh, centered in the semitendinosus muscle and extending to the biceps femoris. Fine-needle aspiration showed a heterogeneous population of ovoid to tapered spindle cells with densely eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional multinucleated cells; no lipogenic differentiation was seen. Immunohistochemistry was positive for desmin and myogenin and negative for CD68, keratin, S-100, SOX-10, HMB-45, and Melan-A. FISH for a FOXO1 13q14 rearrangement was negative. A diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma was made, and the patient received 10 weeks of vincristine/irinotecan chemotherapy per protocol ARST0531. \n\nThe tumor was then completely excised. Grossly, it was a mixed cystic and solid mass with a thin white capsule. H&E sections revealed diffuse sheets of round cells with eosinophilic rhabdomyoblastic cytoplasm and large nuclei. Throughout the tumor, a subset of cells exhibited a spectrum of cytoplasmic vacuolation, from small vacuoles to multiple vacuoles indenting the nucleus, resembling adipocytes or lipoblasts. These vacuolated cells were positive for adipophilin, Oil Red O, and S-100 protein; the vacuoles were negative with periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain, with or without diastase. Immunostaining for desmin was positive in the vacuolated cells, whereas myogenin was negative in their nuclei. There was cystic change, scattered histiocytes, extracellular hemosiderin, low mitotic activity (1 mf/10 hpf), and no coagulative necrosis.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\npembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis\nScleroderma_renal_crisis\nPannus formation\nUterine adenosarcoma\nCryptococcoma\nEssential thrombocytosis\nischemic chiasmopathy\nWhipple\u2019s disease\nDRESS syndrome\nAutoimmune limbic encephalitis\nWernicke encephalopathy\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\nAutoimmuneHemolyticAnemia\nrheumatoid meningitis\nChondrosarcoma\ntuberculous mediastinal abscess\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nAdhesive small bowel obstruction\nHereditary spherocytosis\nHypokalemic paralysis\nIgG4-related periaortitis\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nRasmussen's encephalitis\ndedifferentiated liposarcoma\nIdiopathic carotidynia\neosinophilic and neutrophilic cellulitis\nANCA-associated vasculitis\nExtracutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum\npembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis\nTubulocystic renal cell carcinoma\nembryonal rhabdomyosarcoma\nCharcot spine\nnodular pulmonary amyloidosis\nnegative pressure pulmonary hemorrhage\nfalciform ligament necrosis\nmyocardial infarction\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas\ndedifferentiated liposarcoma\nGradenigo syndrome\nPseudotumor deltoideus\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nCerebral edema\nIntramuscular hemangioma\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nCholinergic urticaria\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nMembranous nephropathy\nrenal artery aneurysm\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nleft atrial thrombus\nFibroma\nidiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nBorderline tuberculoid leprosy\nChronic compartment syndrome\nIntussusception\nCancerAssociatedRetinopathy\nHistiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma\nSMARCA4-DTS\nErdheim-Chester disease\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nparaduodenal pancreatitis\nSweet syndrome\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\ndiabetic polyradiculopathy\nTall cell carcinoma of the breast with reversed polarity\ncysticercosis\nPrimary aldosteronism\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nmelorheostosis\nNonurachal adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder\nendometrioid endocervical adenocarcinoma\ntuberculosis\nsebaceous carcinoma\nAtypical hemolytic uremic syndrome\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\nHashimotos thyroiditis\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\nLeiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminate\nmidbrain infarction\nIntramuscular hemangioma\nCardiacSarcoidosis\nUreteral stone\nHepatic bartonellosis\nIntussusception\nMarginal keratitis\nPrimary CNS melanoma\ncryptogenic embolic stroke\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nFourth branchial cleft anomaly\nHashimotos thyroiditis\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\ncruciate paralysis\nCongenital anterolateral tibial bowing and polydactyly\nSerous cystadenoma\ngiant cell arteritis\nnon-small cell lung cancer\n",

FOXO1 rearrangement was negative, arguing against alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and supporting embryonal type. The resection shows sheets of round rhabdomyoblastic cells with low mitotic activity and no necrosis; the presence of adipophilin/Oil Red O-positive cytoplasmic vacuolation represents lipid accumulation within tumor cells (including desmin-positive vacuolated cells) rather than true lipogenic differentiation, consistent with treated embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and not dedifferentiated liposarcoma (which would not show myogenic markers as a defining feature).",

Initial outpatient treatment with azithromycin followed by garenoxacin yielded no improvement; she then developed muscle pain and lower-extremity edema. \n\nOn admission: temperature 39.7\u00b0C; heart rate 135 bpm; respiratory rate 26/min; oxygen saturation 91% on 1 L nasal cannula; mild respiratory failure. Abdominal examination revealed distension, tympany on percussion, and near-absent bowel sounds. Lung auscultation detected wheezing. Both proximal interphalangeal and ankle joints were swollen and tender, with lower-extremity edema. No rash was present.\n\nDespite treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin, fevers persisted above 39\u00b0C. Abdominal radiography showed marked colonic gas and upward diaphragms. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated mediastinal lymphadenopathy, dilated colon with fluid levels, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and a small pericardial effusion\u2014without mechanical obstruction. Colonoscopy confirmed no obstructing lesion. A diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction was made on hospital Day 5; nasogastric decompression and metoclopramide yielded no improvement. Clostridium difficile tests were negative, and metronidazole produced no response.\n\nOn Day 6 her respiratory status worsened (PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 ratio 177), and she was intubated for presumed ARDS. A salmon-pink, edematous erythema appeared on the trunk and extremities. Discontinuation of all potential culprit drugs failed to improve the rash.\n\nLaboratory studies: WBC 18 560/\u00b5L (89% neutrophils); AST 36 U/L; ALT 45 U/L; LDH 430 U/L; ferritin 3551.4 ng/mL; CRP 27.6 mg/dL; ESR 134 mm/h; procalcitonin 0.4 ng/mL; ANA <1:40; rheumatoid factor 29 IU/mL; C3 and C4 normal; blood cultures and viral serologies (EBV, hepatitis) negative.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\ntight filum terminale\nSpontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nIgA-dominant MPGN\nneuronal intranuclear inclusion disease\ndecompression retinopathy\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nruptured hepatic metastases\nhyperinsulinaemic reactive hypoglycemia\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nVismodegib-induced diarrhea\nacute cerebellitis\nChronicExertionalCompartmentSyndrome\nSpontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nwell-differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nSchizophrenia\nAcute suppurative thyroiditis\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nGiant cell myocarditis\nPseudotumor deltoideus\norganized thrombus\nIsolated arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy\nendometrial stromal sarcoma\nRituximab-induced acute lung injury\nNeurocysticercosis\nnon-exertional hyperthermia\nSweet syndrome\nCancer of unknown primary\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\nneural fibrolipoma\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nMeningioma\nReninoma\nbilateral paramedian thalamic infarction\nHistoplasmosis\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nIntracardiac metastasis\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nFusarium proliferatum\nMyxoma\nStarvation-induced liver enzyme elevation\nMyxedema coma\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nGiant cell myocarditis\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nIgG4-related focal retroperitoneal fibrosis\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nautosensitization reaction\nLoeys-Dietz syndrome\nWilson's disease\nvaricella zoster virus encephalitis\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nMedullary thyroid carcinoma\nParavalvular leakage\neosinophilic and neutrophilic cellulitis\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nCoronaryArterySpasm\nIgG4-related focal retroperitoneal fibrosis\nCardiac angiosarcoma\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\nundifferentiated sarcoma\nColistin neurotoxicity\nrenal arteriovenous malformation\nAbusive abdominal trauma\ncruciate paralysis\nleft atrial thrombus\nRosai\u2013Dorfman disease\nAbusive head trauma\nhydrocephalus\nautosensitization reaction\nMycobacterium marinum\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nInsulinAutoimmuneSyndrome\nPituitary abscess\nIntermittent hydronephrosis\nAnaplasmosis\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nGerminoma\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nAdultOnsetStillsDisease\nOvarianCancer\nPeripheralUlcerativeKeratitis\nAnomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\nMirizzi syndrome\nrenal arteriovenous malformation\nFunctional mitral regurgitation\nOdontogenic cutaneous sinus tract\nlymphangioma\nCerebral edema\nvildagliptin-induced interstitial pneumonia\nMetastatic melanoma\n",

CT of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the cystic left adnexal mass and demonstrated no adrenal mass or other intra-abdominal abnormalities. Initial hyperandrogenism workup revealed a free testosterone of 4.2 pg/ml (normal) but a total testosterone of 264.3 ng/dl (elevated), with DHEA-S 29.2 \u03bcg/dl, CA-125 5 U/ml, and inhibin-A 1 pg/ml all within normal limits. Three months later, the cyst was unchanged but symptoms persisted. On referral to endocrinology, repeat labs showed free testosterone 4.7 pg/ml, total testosterone 276 ng/dl, FSH 41.7 IU/L, LH 26.6 IU/L (postmenopausal range), suppressed 8 am cortisol of 1.0 \u03bcg/dl, and normal DHEA, DHEA-S, and estradiol.

She had no chronic illnesses or relevant family history. Initially, she was diagnosed elsewhere with urinary infection and lumbar discopathy. After persistent symptoms, a standard tube agglutination test (STA) returned positive at 1/320, and she was started on doxycycline and rifampicin. Despite treatment, her back pain intensified, and she was referred to our emergency department.\n\nOn admission: temperature 37.8 \u00b0C; other vitals stable. Examination revealed diffuse tenderness over the thoracolumbar spine; otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL, white blood cell count 10,900/mm3 (53% neutrophils), C\u2010reactive protein 92.9 mg/L (0\u20135), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 71 mm/h, and Rose Bengal plate test negative. Chest radiograph was normal. Blood cultures were obtained.\n\nLumbar MRI was normal. Contrast\u2010enhanced thoracic MRI demonstrated bone marrow edema in T11 and T12, a hyperintense T2 signal in the corresponding disc space with intense contrast enhancement of these vertebrae, and a 2 mm rim\u2010enhancing collection consistent with epidural and anterior paravertebral abscess at T11\u2013T12. Ceftriaxone was added; neurosurgery declined surgical intervention given absence of neurologic deficits. A Brucella Coombs test on serum returned positive at >1/1280. Tuberculin skin testing was negative, and blood cultures remained sterile.\n\nOn hospital day 4, she developed fever to 39 \u00b0C, white blood cell count rose to 21,000/mm3, and CRP to 420 mg/L. Evaluation for a new infectious focus revealed a left pleural fluid collection. Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube, yielding hemopurulent, exudative fluid with numerous leukocytes but no organisms on Gram stain and no growth on culture.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nBrownTumor\nIntraosseous meningioma\nGiant cell tumor of the breast\nextranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma\nMenetrier disease\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nGerminoma\nprimary adrenal insufficiency\nstress cardiomyopathy\nSchwannoma\nInfective endocarditis\nGerminoma\nAmeloblasticFibroma\nGranulocytic sarcoma\nAorticValveFenestrationRupture\nWhipple\u2019s disease\nCongenital anterolateral tibial bowing and polydactyly\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nsyphilis\nGadolinium-induced acute pancreatitis\nVanishing white matter disease\npoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nExtranodal marginal zone lymphoma\nSerpentine-like syndrome\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nWarm autoimmune hemolytic anemia\ntuberculous mediastinal abscess\nAmyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nFibroma\nHyperplastic parathyroid gland seeding\nNoonan syndrome\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\npulmonary artery intimal sarcoma\nBrucellosis\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nsyphilis\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis\nBell's palsy\nHypersensitivity myocarditis\nInfective endocarditis\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nhyperlipemic abdominal crisis\nHDR syndrome\nTakotsubo syndrome\ntype II citrullinemia\nLeft atrial tachycardia\nAcute hepatitis of unknown origin\nmucormycosis\nMalignant granular cell tumor\nscleredema adultorum of Buschke\ntype II citrullinemia\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nabdominal migraine\nfibromuscular dysplasia\nTransverse myelitis\nOvarianCancer\nConstrictive pericarditis\nAdhesive small bowel obstruction\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nAcute hepatitis of unknown origin\nPfeifer-Weber-Christian disease\nPulmonary carcinoid\noromandibular limb hypogenesis syndrome\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\nGaucher disease type 3C\nKapur-Toriello syndrome\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nneural fibrolipoma\nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nMycobacterium marinum\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\nAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma\nAdenocarcinoma of the lesser omentum\nAcute hematogenous osteomyelitis\nMycobacterium marinum infection\nReactive retinal astrocytic tumor\nMalignant granular cell tumor\nhyperlipemic abdominal crisis\nabdominal migraine\nAcquired hemophilia A\nConstrictive pericarditis\nvaricella zoster virus encephalitis\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nX-linked hypophosphatemia\nNoonan syndrome\nHepatocellularcarcinomawithbiliaryandneuroendocrinedifferentiation\nBecker muscular dystrophy\nMcArdle disease\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\nAbusive abdominal trauma\n",

Eighteen days earlier, he was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high-flow nasal cannula and bilevel positive-pressure ventilation. During a 16-day ICU stay at the referring hospital, he underwent frequent arterial blood gas sampling from both radial arteries, multiple venous blood draws, and peripheral IV placements but never had an indwelling arterial line. He reported fatigue, shortness of breath, generalized weakness, and easy bruising and bleeding. His medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol, lisinopril, sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, and therapeutic enoxaparin 90 mg subcutaneously twice daily. On admission, his temperature was 96.7\u00b0F, blood pressure 158/70 mm Hg, heart rate 104 beats/min, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 88% on 10 L nasal cannula. Examination revealed diffuse bilateral inspiratory crackles, anasarca, and mild tenderness and swelling of the right wrist and hand with bruising on the volar wrist. Radial and ulnar pulses were palpable; sensation and motor strength were intact; the right fingers felt cool. Electrolytes and renal function were normal.

On examination, she had no focal deficits beyond gait ataxia. MRI of the brain showed nonenhancing T2 FLAIR hyperintense white matter abnormalities in deep structures. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a normal cell count and protein, cytology with atypical lymphoid cells, and flow cytometry with an abnormal mature B-cell population that could not be further characterized. CSF viral studies, CSF oligoclonal bands, and both CSF and serum paraneoplastic panels were negative. A whole-body PET scan showed no evidence of new disease, and ophthalmologic examination was normal.\n\nHer clinical trial drug was held, but over the next month she developed intermittent diplopia, neck-extensor weakness, and worsening inability to ambulate. Repeat MRI demonstrated new contrast-enhancing lesions in the corpus callosum. Repeat CSF again showed atypical cells and an abnormal B-cell population, with persistently normal cell count and protein. The differential diagnosis included an inflammatory or autoimmune process, a drug-related process from her MPNST treatment, or a new neoplastic process. Given the deep location of the lesions, brain biopsy was initially deferred, and she received high-dose methylprednisolone for presumed autoimmune or drug-related disease.\n\nOver the next several months, her MRI findings fluctuated, and she underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy of an enhancing lesion that showed gliosis with mild\u2013moderate parenchymal and perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Genomic testing of the biopsy sample was nondiagnostic. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and a prednisone taper, but her symptoms continued to worsen. She then underwent plasma exchange followed by additional intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab, without clinical or radiographic improvement.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nPost-traumatic facial hematoma\nepiploic appendage band\nPost-traumatic facial hematoma\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\nHyperplastic parathyroid gland seeding\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nUpper septal fascicular ventricular tachycardia\nFolateDeficientOpticNeuropathy\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage\nMycosis fungoides\nFactorXIIIdeficiency\nsarcoidosis\ncompartment syndrome\nPost-traumatic facial hematoma\nPineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation\nabdominal migraine\nPFAPAsyndrome\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nIris stromal proliferation\nBrucellosis\nMorgellons disease\nCeliac disease\ndiabetic myonecrosis\nBartonella neuroretinitis\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\narachnoid cyst\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\nAdamantinoma\nAbusive abdominal trauma\nEarly repolarization syndrome\nsubpleural pulmonary cysts\nPrimary aldosteronism\nFibroma\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\nSecondary syphilis\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nTuberculousPeritonitis\nAdenosine-sensitive atrial tachycardia\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\nHDR syndrome\nMucosal neuroma syndrome\nCharcot spine\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nrenal arteriovenous malformation\nMethanol toxicity\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis\nBrucellosis\nSBP-101 induced retinal toxicity\nWilson's disease\nWernicke encephalopathy\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nSMARCA4-DTS\nCholinergic urticaria\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\ntuberculosis\nAutoimmuneHemolyticAnemia\nPrimary testicular lymphoma\nsebaceous carcinoma\nPFAPAsyndrome\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nparaneoplastic leukemoid reaction\nEwing sarcoma\nPhototoxic reaction\nosteoma cutis\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nGerm cell tumor\nextranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nSolitary fibrous tumor\nFolateDeficientOpticNeuropathy\nHereditary spherocytosis\nconjunctival cyst\nsubglottic cyst\ngallbladder torsion\nossifying fibromyxoid tumor\ndiabetic myonecrosis\nGiant bullous emphysema\nxanthoma disseminatum\ntype II citrullinemia\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nKnobloch syndrome\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nstress cardiomyopathy\ncoronary pseudoaneurysm\nBardet\u2010Biedl syndrome\nPulmonary carcinoid\nruptured hepatic metastases\nneuroendocrine carcinoma\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nUveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\npulmonary artery intimal sarcoma\nFamilial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nGranular cell tumor\n",

            "reasoning": "The patient developed a progressive subacute neurologic syndrome with deep white matter T2/FLAIR abnormalities that later showed new enhancing corpus callosum lesions. CSF repeatedly demonstrated atypical lymphoid cells and flow cytometry repeatedly identified an abnormal mature B-cell population, despite normal cell count and protein and negative infectious/paraneoplastic testing. Whole-body PET showed no systemic lymphoma and ophthalmologic exam was normal, supporting a CNS-limited process. Lack of sustained response to high-dose steroids, IVIG, plasma exchange, and rituximab argues against a purely autoimmune/drug-related encephalitis and is compatible with an underlying CNS B-cell malignancy, which can also yield nondiagnostic biopsy showing only gliosis/inflammation due to sampling error and steroid effect.

One year earlier, he developed acute hepatitis (AST 1750 U/L, ALT 3110 U/L, T-bil 8.9 mg/dL) one month after influenza vaccination; a liver biopsy at that time showed prominent lymphocytic portal infiltration. Six months later he had a second episode of hepatitis (AST 957 U/L, ALT 1970 U/L) accompanied by leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia; viral serologies (hepatitis A, B, C, E, cytomegalovirus) and autoantibodies were negative, and liver enzymes normalized without treatment, but cytopenias persisted. Seven months later, he presented with fatigue and again had elevated transaminases (AST 434 U/L, ALT 1017 U/L). \n\nOn admission he was afebrile, normotensive, without jaundice or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory findings included: AST 501 U/L, ALT 1165 U/L, ALP 429 U/L, \u03b3-GTP 103 U/L, T-bil 1.0 mg/dL, albumin 4.5 g/dL, PT-INR 0.96. Complete blood count: WBC 2.35\u00d710^3/\u03bcL, neutrophils 0.94\u00d710^3/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 14.0 g/dL, reticulocytes 8.0\u00d710^4/\u03bcL, platelets 3.0\u00d710^4/\u03bcL. Serologies remained negative for HBsAg, HCV IgG, CMV IgM, EBV IgM, antinuclear and antimitochondrial antibodies; immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT showed mild splenomegaly but unremarkable liver morphology. \n\nA transjugular liver biopsy was performed and compared with the specimen from one year earlier. The earlier specimen showed prominent lymphocytic infiltration in portal areas; the current specimen showed disappearance of lymphocytes, replacement by histiocytes, bridging hepatic necrosis in portal regions, and new centrilobular fibrosis.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nLung adenocarcinoma\nlepromatous leprosy\nCyclophosphamide\u2010induced diabetes mellitus\nmyocardial infarction\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nleprosy\nlymphangitis carcinomatosa\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome\nposterior elbow impingement\nLower oesophageal stricture\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nSerous cystadenoma\nRhabdomyolysis\nStrumaOvarii\nOvarianCancer\ncongenital pulmonary airway malformation\nancient schwannoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas\nRenalArteryOcclusion\nMyocarditis\nmetastatic retinoblastoma\ndecompression retinopathy\nAbdominal migraine\nUveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nOrbital myositis\nRhD alloimmunization\nneural fibrolipoma\nSertoli-Leydig cell tumor\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\ntumor-induced osteomalacia\nReactive arthritis\nCardiac myxoma\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\ntorsion of a subserosal uterine leiomyoma\nCalyceal rupture\nRetinal neovascularization\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nMefloquine toxicity\nAbusive abdominal trauma\nIgA-dominant MPGN\nbiliary foreign body\nlepromatous leprosy\nPineal parenchymal tumour of intermediate differentiation\nossifying fibromyxoid tumor\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\ngeneralized lymphangiomatosis\nFactitious Cushing syndrome\ntransient brachial plexus block\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nRetinal neovascularization\nMetastatic melanoma\nmyocardial infarction\nsulfonylurea poisoning\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nFetus in fetu\nleiomyosarcoma\nCryptococcoma\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\nPanton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia\nanisakiasis\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nSubclavian artery stenosis\nMycobacterium marinum\nCoronaryArterySpasm\ncentral diabetes insipidus\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nCandidiasis\nMycobacterium avium complex\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nEssential thrombocytosis\nMalakoplakia\nExtralobarPulmonarySequestration\nStarvation-induced liver enzyme elevation\nPrimary generalized epilepsy\nRheumatoid arthritis\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nextranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nlymphangioma\nChondrosarcoma\nbiliary pancreatitis\nmyocardial infarction\nRheumatoid nodules\nbiliary pancreatitis\nsclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\nParaganglioma\ntuberculosis\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nvitamin D\u2013dependent rickets type II\nMultilocularThymicCyst\nAtypical hemolytic uremic syndrome\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\ndecompression retinopathy\nGliomatosis cerebri\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\n",

She denied ingestion of caustic substances or foreign bodies. An ENT examination was unremarkable; she could swallow saliva and small amounts of water. A barium swallow study the next day was normal.\n\nTwo weeks later, her dysphagia persisted. She was limited to soft foods and liquids, with no weight loss or reflux. She described three choking episodes in the month before her first visit and anxiety about solids lodging in her throat. She denied additional trauma. Her history included mild anxiety and depression managed in outpatient psychiatry after self-harm one year earlier; she had no current psychiatric treatment. Repeat ENT examination was again normal; she declined fiberoptic endoscopy but agreed to evaluation by a speech and language pathologist (SLP).\n\nThree weeks later, SLP assessment showed normal oral sensorimotor function, an EAT-10 score of 10/40 (normal <3), and a prolonged swallowing capacity of 150 ml water in 26.9 s (normal <15 s). A video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) performed four weeks later was inconclusive: she could ingest only minute solid or semisolid pieces, and liquids were within normal limits but taken in very small sips.\n\nAt a pediatric clinic consultation, neurological, cardiac, ENT, and abdominal examinations were normal.

The pain began in the right knee after a long walk, was of fairly rapid onset, and was associated with swelling; within weeks, the left knee became similarly affected. The pain was localized to the knees and was continuous with intermittent exacerbations, being worse in the mornings and at rest. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provided only mild relief.\n\nTwo months after symptom onset, laboratory studies showed an ESR of 5 mm/hr, CRP of 4 mg/L, and normal ACE level; sickle-cell trait testing was negative. MRI of the right knee demonstrated a small joint effusion without synovial thickening. Synovial fluid aspiration yielded an almost acellular specimen; cultures were negative. A transient ecchymosis-like rash around the knee was attributed to warm compresses.\n\nOver the next nine months, he was admitted several times with severe knee pain but no fevers, systemic rash, or other systemic features. On initial rheumatology evaluation, his vital signs were normal. Examination revealed a small right knee effusion and pain on flexion; the knee posture was held in slight flexion but could be extended to neutral.\n\nOne month later, he reported difficulty standing and required assistance with dressing because of lower-limb weakness. Examination revealed bilateral calf and thigh hypertrophy (more pronounced in thighs). Strength was 5/5 in neck, upper limbs, abdominal, and shoulder muscles; assessment of lower limbs was limited by pain, but quadriceps strength appeared reduced. Timed rises from the floor and from lying were within normal limits. He had tight long flexors of the arms, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. Hyperpigmented patches were noted over the right knee and thigh, thought secondary to compresses.\n\nSubsequently, he experienced worsening nocturnal leg pain. Laboratory studies showed ALT 145 U/L, CK 13 126 U/L, LDH 2245 U/L, with persistently normal ESR and CRP; ANA was negative. Muscle ultrasound of the quadriceps was normal. MRI of the thigh and calf muscles revealed mildly reduced posterior-compartment muscle bulk with asymmetric edema. On fat-suppressed STIR images, there was signal hyperintensity in the right sartorius and medial gastrocnemius extending into adjacent fascia, and similar edema in other selective thigh and calf muscles.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nGuillain-Barre syndrome\nfunctional dysphagia\nSusac syndrome\ncardioinhibitory reflex syncope\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\nGuillain-Barre syndrome\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nconjunctival cyst\nepinephrine toxicity\nMeningioma\nEndogenous Candida endophthalmitis\nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nplasmablastic myeloma\nossifying fibroma\nosteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\nVanishing bone disease\nObesity-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nRhD alloimmunization\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\nneuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus\nneonatal breast enlargement\nAdrenal insufficiency\nSLE myocarditis\nHereditary spherocytosis\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nlymphangitis carcinomatosa\nPulmonary carcinoid\nFactorXIIIdeficiency\neosinophilic and neutrophilic cellulitis\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\nadult-onset Still disease\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nGerminoma\nPostoperative inflammation\nnecrotizing autoimmune myopathy\nCardiac angiosarcoma\nEsophageal rupture\ndissociative_conversion_disorder_unspecified\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nCalyceal rupture\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\nparaproteinemic keratopathy\nHypertrophic lichen planus\nBucillamine-induced pneumonitis\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nHypokalemic paralysis\nIsolated arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\nOrnithineTranscarbamylaseDeficiency\nSarcoidosis\nObesity-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nneurogenic pulmonary edema\nQFever\nneurogenic pulmonary edema\nLoeys-Dietz syndrome\nchemical abscess\nembryonal rhabdomyosarcoma\nEosinophilic gastritis\nEntamoeba histolytica\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis\nToxic anterior segment syndrome\nMyocarditis\nBehcet disease\nacquired hemophilia\nBurkitt's lymphoma\ngeneralized lymphangiomatosis\nLinearAtrophodermaOfMoulin\nMycobacterium bovis\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\npleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma\nAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma\nautosensitization reaction\nReel syndrome\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nMethemoglobinemia\nOvarianCancer\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nUreteral stone\nMembranous nephropathy\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nHypereosinophilic syndrome\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\nCholinergic urticaria\ncold agglutinin disease\nAcinic cell carcinoma\nSerotonin syndrome\nMyocarditis\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus infection\npulmonary bulla\nHereditary spherocytosis\nmembranous glomerulonephritis\nKimura\u2019s disease\nleft atrial thrombus\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease\n",

She also reported migratory pain involving her ankles, knees, and hips of the same duration; the pain worsened with activity and was not associated with morning stiffness. She had no history of sexual activity, no family history of tuberculosis or rheumatologic disease, and had received BCG vaccination at birth. \n\nOn examination, she was afebrile. There was mild swelling of the left ankle without erythema, tenderness, or limitation of movement; all other joints and the remainder of her examination were normal. Initial complete blood count and creatine phosphokinase level were normal; radiographs of the hands and knees showed no erosions. She was treated with NSAIDs and other symptomatic measures, but her pain worsened over the next week, now involving her wrists and small joints of the hands bilaterally. She failed to respond to escalated analgesic therapy, and developed low-grade fevers to 37.8 \u00b0C, anorexia, fatigue, a 2-kg weight loss, and a mild nonproductive cough. \n\nLaboratory testing revealed an ESR of 72 mm/hour and a CRP of 4.9 mg/dL. A tapering course of corticosteroids produced partial relief of pain but persistent daily fevers. Ten days after steroids were discontinued, she returned with worsening polyarthritis, fevers to 37.8 \u00b0C, an additional 2-kg weight loss, and cough. Her ESR was 70 mm/hour, CRP 5.3 mg/dL, and ferritin 204 mg/dL; ANA was positive, but ASMA, AMA, anti\u2013dsDNA, and RF were negative.

A strongly positive new PPD conversion (22 mm after being negative 2 years prior) in the setting of pulmonary infiltrates supports active tuberculosis infection.

His medical history was otherwise noncontributory, aside from an epileptic attack in childhood; dental history included extraction of his lower front teeth one year earlier.  \nOn examination, he had hypertelorism, a flat nasal bridge, saddle nose, mild webbing of the neck, pectus excavatum, arachnodactyly, and clubbing of the nails. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable, and electrocardiography was normal. A hand\u2013wrist radiograph showed a missing carpal bone with no fusion of the remaining carpal bones. Hematology revealed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (179 U/L).  \nIntraoral examination showed multiple submerged and retained deciduous teeth (numbers 53, 54, 55, 63, 64, 65, 73, 74, 75, 84, and 85), a deep bite, a high\u2010arched palate, gingival overgrowth with supernumerary teeth in the lower anterior region, and grade I mobility of the lower permanent incisors. Numerous permanent teeth (12, 14, 15, 22, 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, 43, 44, 45, and 46) were unerupted; all erupted teeth were caries\u2010free.  \nAn orthopantomogram revealed three supernumerary lower anterior teeth, congenitally missing teeth (12, 22, 38, and 48), multiple impacted permanent teeth, and an impacted mandibular right first permanent molar (tooth 46) with divergent roots. Cephalometric analysis demonstrated a skeletal Class I malocclusion with orthognathic maxilla and mandible, a horizontal growth pattern, and retroclined upper and lower incisors.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nRosaiDorfmanDisease\nNoonan syndrome\nIgG4-related disease\nHepatic bartonellosis\nadrenal hemorrhage\nsuperior orbital fissure syndrome\nAbusive head trauma\ntorsion of a subserosal uterine leiomyoma\nTraumatic coronary artery injury\nIris stromal proliferation\nIgG4-related disease\nAcute suppurative thyroiditis\nosteoma cutis\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\nanisakiasis\nKawasaki disease\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nMyxoma\nancient schwannoma\nAdrenal insufficiency\nhypercupremia\nIron refractory iron deficiency anemia\nPortosystemic shunt\nStreptococcus salivarius pneumonia\nSteroid-responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis\nTall cell carcinoma of the breast with reversed polarity\nReel syndrome\nvertebral hemangioma\nsarcoidosis\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nThrombocytopenia-associated multiorgan failure\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nopioid-induced catatonia\nNonrheumatic myocarditis\nPoncet\u2019s disease\nMefloquine toxicity\nUveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\nEosinophilic gastritis\nBucillamine-induced pneumonitis\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\ndrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nFibrous meningioma\nRetinal neovascularization\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nmelanoma\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nAmeloblasticFibroma\npulmonary cryptococcosis\nSchwannoma\nMDMA toxicity\nCentral-variant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nPFAPAsyndrome\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\nBartonella neuroretinitis\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nhypercupremia\nSchwannoma\nMethotrexate pneumonitis\nPosterior ischemic optic neuropathy\nfalciform ligament necrosis\nchemical abscess\nPseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B\nParavalvular leakage\nParathyroidAdenoma\nMalignant melanoma\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\ntype II citrullinemia\nHepatocellularcarcinomawithbiliaryandneuroendocrinedifferentiation\nGuillain-Barre syndrome\npulmonary bulla\nbiliary foreign body\nKapur-Toriello syndrome\nneurosyphilis\nPseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B\nMyocarditis\nDiabetic myonecrosis\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\nUterine adenosarcoma\nPrimary aldosteronism\nHashimotos thyroiditis\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\nFetus in fetu\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nMultipleSclerosis\nCardiac myxoma\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nFibroma\nLipoma\ncerebral arterial air embolism\n",

He had presented 6 days earlier with similar symptoms but left against medical advice. On arrival, he reported intractable nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, photophobia, anuria, and myalgia; he denied cough, fevers, chills, or night sweats. He used cocaine regularly but denied alcohol, tobacco, and intravenous drugs. He had no recent travel.\n\nVital signs: afebrile; blood pressure 177/65 mm\u2009Hg; heart rate 77/min; respiratory rate 16/min; oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Examination revealed scleral icterus, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice of the soft palate, and a supple neck. Cardiopulmonary exam showed a heaving, laterally displaced point of maximal impulse with regular rate and rhythm. Abdominal exam disclosed epigastric tenderness without guarding or rigidity, normal bowel sounds, and a negative Murphy\u2019s sign.\n\nLaboratory studies showed: \n\u2022 Lipase >3\u00d7 upper limit of normal  \n\u2022 Mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic liver injury (elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT)  \n\u2022 Thrombocytopenia  \n\u2022 Acute renal failure (creatinine 10.4 mg/dL)  \n\u2022 Elevated creatine kinase  \n\nUrinalysis revealed hematuria, pyuria, leukocyte esterase, and hyaline casts.\n\nInitial differential: hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).  \n\u2022 Peripheral-blood smear: thrombocytopenia without schistocytes.  \n\u2022 ADAMTS13 activity: normal.  \n\u2022 Stool cultures: negative for Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Salmonella.\n\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected but anti\u2013platelet factor 4 antibodies were negative. Serologic and PCR testing for CMV, EBV, and HIV were negative.

She was born at term without complications; her maternal aunt had autoimmune disease. Vaccinations were incomplete (no MMR, varicella, or fourth DTaP). History included recurrent otitis media (with tubes) and eczema. Initial tests showed positive mumps IgM; elevated IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgG subclasses; positive rhinovirus and enterovirus; negative CMV, HIV, and hepatitis panels. She was leukopenic with cold-agglutinin autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Exam revealed mild hepatosplenomegaly and small mobile cervical nodes. EBV serologies indicated acute infection, with plasma EBV load 9 000\u201320 600 copies/\u03bcL. Flow cytometry showed reduced B, T, and NK cells. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and symptomatic improvement, chest radiography and CT demonstrated persistent bilateral perihilar and right middle lobe infiltrates.

Her past medical history included glaucoma, hip arthrosis, and cystocele repair. She was a non-smoker with no relevant exposures. Medications: boric acid and timolol eye drops. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed WBC 4860/\u03bcl, hemoglobin 133 g/l, platelets 205 000/\u03bcl, normal PT and aPTT, D-dimer 5360 ng/ml, calcium 2.35 mEq/l, albumin 4.3 U/l, potassium 4.3 mEq/l, CRP 3.4 mg/l, creatinine 0.852 mg/dl, LDH 306 UI/l, and normal liver tests. Chest radiography revealed multiple bilateral nodules. CT pulmonary angiography confirmed bilateral pulmonary emboli and multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, some calcified, the largest measuring 35 mm in the right middle lobe. She was anticoagulated with enoxaparin. Flexible bronchoscopy was normal; bronchoalveolar lavage was nondiagnostic, with no AFB on microscopy and negative cultures for bacteria, nocardia, mycobacteria, and fungus. CT-guided lung biopsy demonstrated amorphous eosinophilic material with surrounding plasma cells and no neoplastic cells. 18F-FDG PET-CT showed intense uptake in all pulmonary nodules (SUVmax 8.8) without hypermetabolic lesions elsewhere. Autoimmune serologies were negative (ANA, ANCA); ACE was normal. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal, but immunofixation revealed an isolated monoclonal kappa IgM.

Twenty days before admission, she developed intermittent left occipital headache lasting 2\u20133 minutes per episode, followed by low-grade fever, sore throat, and dry cough. Initial outpatient treatment provided only transient relief. Fifteen days before admission, fever recurred (to 38 \u00b0C), with marked fatigue, persistent dry cough, nausea, and non-projectile vomiting. One week before admission, she noted memory loss, bilateral hearing loss, and limb weakness; urinary incontinence developed the next day without altered consciousness. Three days before admission, dyspnea worsened, and she was transferred to the MICU after rapid progression to severe hypoxemia and lethargy, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n\nHer medical history was notable for hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine) and chronic hepatitis B (on entecavir), with normal thyroid and liver function pre-illness. She had no diabetes, head trauma, psychiatric disease, tuberculosis, or malignancy. She denied smoking, drug abuse, recent travel, tick bites, and any known contact with birds, poultry, or horses.\n\nOn MICU admission (day 1): temperature 39.0 \u00b0C; pulse 128 beats/min; respiratory rate 20 breaths/min; blood pressure 105/78 mmHg on dopamine infusion; SpO\u2082 96.4% on FiO\u2082 0.90.

Two months earlier, she had undergone transurethral resection for early bladder cancer and then began weekly intravesical BCG instillations. Eight days after the third instillation, she noted abrupt leg weakness that gradually worsened over the next three weeks until she was bedridden.\n\nHer medical history included dyslipidemia treated with rosuvastatin for over two years and treated rectal and endometrial cancers without recurrence. On readmission, vital signs were stable. Neurologic examination showed symmetric proximal weakness (modified MRC grade 2/5 in arms, 3/5 in legs), with normal reflexes and sensation; she denied myalgia or urine\u2010color changes.\n\nLaboratory tests revealed hemoglobin 6.7 g/dL, WBC 12,850/\u03bcL (89% neutrophils), AST 2,235 IU/L, ALT 1,189 IU/L, BUN 146.4 mg/dL, creatinine 5.74 mg/dL, potassium 8.0 mmol/L, and CK >13,000 IU/L.

ECGs during episodes demonstrated a wide\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS ~130 ms) with right bundle branch block morphology and left\u2010axis deviation. Intravenous verapamil consistently terminated the tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart.\n\nDuring electrophysiological study, catheters were placed in the high right atrium, His\u2010bundle region, right ventricular apex, and coronary sinus. Baseline conduction intervals were normal, with no evidence of dual AV nodal physiology, manifest preexcitation, or concealed accessory pathway conduction. The clinical tachycardia was reproducibly induced by right ventricular burst pacing and isoprenaline infusion. It was regular with a cycle length of 290 ms and a QRS duration of 135 ms showing right bundle branch block and left\u2010axis deviation. There was 1:1 ventriculoatrial association with earliest atrial activation near the His bundle and a negative HV interval. Atrial pacing at a cycle length much shorter than the tachycardia cycle length dissociated atrial from ventricular activity, whereas atrial overdrive pacing demonstrated progressive fusion consistent with entrainment. Based on these findings and consistent termination with overdrive RV pacing and verapamil, a diagnosis of the left posterior fascicular variant of ILVT was made.\n\nAn octapolar catheter was positioned retrogradely to map the left ventricular septum during tachycardia. Presystolic Purkinje potentials were recorded 28 ms before QRS onset in the distal third of the left posterior apical septum. Radiofrequency energy was applied to the mid\u2010apical posterior interventricular septum. Immediately during energy delivery, the wide\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS width 135 ms; cycle length 299 ms) abruptly transitioned to a regular narrow\u2010complex tachycardia (QRS width 85 ms; cycle length 281 ms) with 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction, a relatively short VA interval, and concentric atrial activation.\n\nWhat is the most likely mechanism and diagnosis of this narrow\u2010complex tachycardia?\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nhypercupremia\nTakayasu arteritis\nbiliary pancreatitis\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\nAmeloblasticFibroma\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nPulmonary carcinoid\nExtranodal marginal zone lymphoma\nAzathioprine hypersensitivity syndrome\nAbdominal migraine\nnodular regenerative hyperplasia\nAdenosine-sensitive atrial tachycardia\nAcute hepatitis of unknown origin\nWhipple\u2019s disease\nPannus formation\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nHemorrhagic pericardial effusion from blunt chest trauma\nHepatic bartonellosis\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nCardiac metastasis\nUpper septal fascicular ventricular tachycardia\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\ncaseous mitral annular calcification\nIntestinal tuberculosis\nHerpes simplex virus 1 encephalitis\nMalignant granular cell tumor\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\nScrub typhus\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\nParaneoplastic cholestasis\nDuodromic tachycardia\nFetus in fetu\ncysticercosis\nlichen spinulosus\nurticaria multiforme\nSecondary syphilis\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis\nLipidKeratopathy\nWilson's disease\nkeratoacanthoma\nMoyamoya disease\nSMART syndrome\nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nsuperior orbital fissure syndrome\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\ngerminoma\nPulmonary embolism\nK\u00fcttner's tumor\nMicronodular thymic carcinoma with lymphoid hyperplasia\nMycobacterium avium complex\nLuschka duct cyst\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage\nCentral-variant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nAdenosine-sensitive atrial tachycardia\nAbusive head trauma\nMyofascialPainSyndrome\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\nDiabetic myonecrosis\nparaproteinemic keratopathy\nacute interstitial nephritis\nintralobar pulmonary sequestration\nMethanol toxicity\nStrumaOvarii\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nBinswanger disease\nneural fibrolipoma\nhydrocephalus\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nReninoma\nColistin neurotoxicity\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis\nRosaiDorfmanDisease\ncerebral arterial air embolism\nParaneoplastic cholestasis\nNeuroblastoma\nMemantine overdose\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\nRituximab-induced acute lung injury\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nCardiac myxoma\nCystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nGenital herpes\nNitrofurantoin-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome\nPOEMSSyndrome\nDiabetic myonecrosis\nCOVID-19 myocarditis\nstress cardiomyopathy\nundifferentiated sarcoma\nLymphocytic myocarditis\nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\n",

Initial labs showed an ALT of 42 IU/L. Right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated hepatomegaly and steatosis. Two weeks later she returned with worsening abdominal pain, low-grade fevers, nausea, and vomiting. MRI of the abdomen revealed a 2 cm enhancing lesion in the right hepatic lobe. Fine-needle biopsy showed a nonspecific mixed inflammatory infiltrate and steatohepatitis without evidence of malignancy; fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative, and she was discharged without treatment.\n\nTwo months later she presented again with worsening right upper quadrant pain and fever. Abdominal CT revealed a 4.8 \u00d7 4.7 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe suspicious for malignancy, prompting a partial right hepatectomy. Histopathology revealed florid necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with pseudotumor formation; immunohistochemical stains for mycobacteria, fungal organisms, and cytomegalovirus were negative. Her symptoms initially resolved.\n\nIn April 2009, she experienced recurrent right upper quadrant pain with low-grade fevers. An extensive evaluation\u2014including serologies for acute viral hepatitis, toxoplasmosis, HIV, Entamoeba histolytica, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp.; testing for urinary Histoplasma and Blastomyces antigens and cryptococcal antigens; and tuberculin skin testing with Quantiferon\u2014was entirely negative. A random liver biopsy showed mild steatosis and nonspecific chronic inflammation; special stains and cultures remained negative.\n\nIn July 2009, she again developed right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and fevers up to 102.4 \u00b0F. CT of the abdomen revealed multiple low-attenuation lesions in both hepatic lobes.

The pain worsened with eating, leading to a 5\u2009kg weight loss. She denied fever, night sweats, skin lesions, known allergies, atopy, or family history of similar illness. Initial evaluation elsewhere included an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy that revealed an antral ulcer; no biopsy was taken. Empiric clarithromycin\u2010based and then levofloxacin\u2010based Helicobacter pylori regimens were prescribed without improvement. \n\nOn examination, she was hemodynamically stable, with conjunctival pallor and tenderness in the left upper quadrant; no lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or ascites were noted. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin 9.1\u2009g/dL, total leukocyte count and differential within normal limits, and an absolute eosinophil count of 147/mm3. A fecal occult blood test was positive. \n\nA repeat upper endoscopy demonstrated a large ulcer on the lesser curvature of the antrum.

Family history was negative for heart disease. Before discharge, transthoracic echocardiography showed moderate tricuspid regurgitation due to valvular dysplasia; all other findings were normal. She was discharged for follow-up.\n\nOn day 6 of life she was admitted with tachypnea, sweating, and failure to thrive; weight was 3.220\u2009kg. Signs of heart failure and respiratory distress were present: O2 saturation 96% on 6\u2009L/min, venous blood gas revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.03, pO2 46\u2009mmHg, pCO2 29\u2009mmHg, HCO3\u2013\u200912.3\u2009mmol/L, BE \u201319). Mechanical ventilation was initiated. On arrival: BP 70/30\u2009mmHg, HR 130\u2009bpm, diuresis preserved. Examination showed a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, weak femoral pulses, and hepatomegaly (liver palpable 3\u2009cm below costal margin).\n\nLaboratory studies: high-sensitivity troponin T 1001\u2009ng/L, CK-MB 37.4\u2009mcg/L; venous blood gas on admission pH 7.1, pO2 65\u2009mmHg, pCO2 28\u2009mmHg, lactate 14.8\u2009mmol/L. Viral studies were negative. Chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary venous congestion.\n\nECG demonstrated sinus rhythm at 133\u2009bpm, right atrial enlargement, inferior Q waves, and lateral repolarization abnormalities. TTE revealed a normal-sized left ventricle with hypokinesis of the inferior wall, dyskinesis of the septum, and mildly depressed ejection fraction; the right ventricle was enlarged with mildly impaired systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation were present. The right coronary artery origin was normal; the left coronary artery was not well visualized.\n\nSelective coronary angiography confirmed normal origin and anatomy of both coronary arteries and normal hemodynamic parameters. With mechanical ventilation and diuretics, hemodynamics improved and heart failure resolved.

Viral studies were negative, and the course was rapidly reversible within hours to a day with normalization of ventricular function and wall motion and falling biomarkers, which is characteristic of stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy rather than myocarditis or fixed ischemic disease.

She had undergone laparoscopic myomectomy at age 25, during which uterine leiomyoma fragments were removed with surgical scissors in a collection bag. Four laparoscopic scars were noted; the mass was not palpable. Laboratory studies, including serum CA 19-9 (\u22641.2 U/mL), CEA (0.6 ng/mL), CA-125 (9.5 U/mL), and sIL-2R (206 U/mL), were within normal limits, as were other routine tests. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a well-defined 38 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 42 mm pelvic mass with central enhancement in the early phase and peripheral enhancement in the late phase, with a feeding vessel from the second sigmoidal artery and no evidence of invasion or metastasis. T2-weighted MRI demonstrated high signal intensity at the tumor margins and low signal centrally, while T1-weighted images showed heterogeneous low signal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic, heterogeneous mass with a clear capsule and pulsatile internal blood flow. FDG PET\u2013CT showed nodular uptake in the pelvis (SUVmax 3.2) without distant lesions. Colonoscopy was unremarkable. The preoperative differential diagnosis included schwannoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma, desmoid tumor, and solitary fibrous tumor. Because it was difficult to differentiate benign from malignant, surgical resection en bloc was planned without breaching the capsule.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\ntransient brachial plexus block\ndiabetic hemichorea hemiballismus\nPolycythemia vera\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nMycosis fungoides\narachnoid cyst\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nLower oesophageal stricture\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nFactitious disorder\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\nOculomotor mononeuropathy\nKaposi sarcoma\nsuperior orbital fissure syndrome\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\nleprosy\nEsophageal rupture\nSLE myocarditis\nUnilateral absence of a pulmonary artery\nJunctionalEctopicTachycardia\nANCA-associated vasculitis\nBreast carcinoma\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\nPulmonary carcinoid\nUreteral stone\nScleroderma_renal_crisis\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nHirayama disease\nRhabdomyolysis\nNonfunctioningPituitaryMacroadenoma\nfunctional dysphagia\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nmicrovascular angina\nBartonella neuroretinitis\nTumid lupus erythematosus\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\nCardiacSarcoidosis\nMucosal neuroma syndrome\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nepinephrine toxicity\nacute renal allograft rejection\nCervical carcinoma\nabdominal migraine\nParaneoplastic cholestasis\nMicronodular thymic carcinoma with lymphoid hyperplasia\nappendicitis\nUveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\nPleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma\nFactor XIIII deficiency\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\nFunctionalNeurologicalDisorder\nErdheim-Chester disease\nEndogenous Candida endophthalmitis\nNeurosyphilis\nacute interstitial nephritis\nPulmonary carcinoid\nUnilateral absence of a pulmonary artery\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nFraser syndrome\ntight filum terminale\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nRenalArteryOcclusion\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nanisakiasis\nPolycythemia vera\nWarm autoimmune hemolytic anemia\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\nFirst bite syndrome\nBinswanger disease\nlymphangioma\nParasitic leiomyoma\nintravascular large B-cell lymphoma\nSebaceous carcinoma\nhyperinsulinaemic reactive hypoglycemia\nLeiomyosarcoma\nGradenigo syndrome\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nEwing sarcoma\ncow\u2019s milk protein allergy\nPsoriasis\npulmonary artery intimal sarcoma\nMcArdle disease\ncystic lymphangioma\nMembranous nephropathy\nLipidKeratopathy\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\nparaproteinemic keratopathy\nEmphysematous cystitis\nWernicke encephalopathy\nToxic anterior segment syndrome\nIntracardiac metastasis\nacquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia\nQFever\npseudoaneurysm\nFamilial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\n",

He denied saddle anesthesia or bowel/bladder incontinence. He was treated empirically for sciatica with prednisone 10 mg daily without relief. He then experienced an episode of leg weakness and was admitted for evaluation. \n\nOn examination, vital signs were stable. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy. Neurologic examination showed intact strength and sensation in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies revealed a normal complete blood count, normal serum electrolytes, and a normal serum calcium level of 8.1 mg/dL. HIV serologies were negative.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine demonstrated multiple enhancing lesions in the T11, T12, L3, and L4 vertebral bodies, right sacrum, and ilium, with retropulsion causing effacement of the lateral recesses at L3\u2013L4 and L4\u2013L5; a small epidural lesion was noted at T5 without significant cord compression. Additional osseous lesions were seen in the sternum and multiple ribs.\n\nComputed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, mild cardiomegaly, a dilated main pulmonary artery (3.6 cm), hepatomegaly (18.1 cm), splenomegaly (12.4 cm), and multiple enlarged pelvic sidewall, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. Testicular ultrasound was normal. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine immunofixation, \u03b2-hCG levels, and fecal occult blood testing were all negative.\n\nA CT-guided core biopsy of a left iliac crest lesion revealed noncaseating and necrotizing granulomas; Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver and Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stains were negative. Endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node demonstrated nonnecrotizing granulomas without malignant cells; fungal and acid-fast cultures were negative. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was 62 U/L (reference 14\u201382).\n\nOne month later, an excisional biopsy of a left inguinal lymph node again showed necrotizing and nonnecrotizing granulomatous lymphadenopathy without evidence of fungal or acid-fast organisms. An ^18F-FDG PET scan revealed extensive hypermetabolic osseous and nodal uptake.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nMenetrier disease\nMethemoglobinemia\nendometrial stromal sarcoma\nMultilocularThymicCyst\nAndersen\u2013Tawil syndrome\nPosterior ischemic optic neuropathy\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nLeiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminate\nxanthoma disseminatum\nAtypical mastocytoma\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nAndersen\u2013Tawil syndrome\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nMultiple sclerosis\nsarcoidosis\nBenign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma\nAnomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery\nFibrous meningioma\nparaganglioma\nlymphangioma\nMenetrier disease\nWhipple\u2019s disease\nTumid lupus erythematosus\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults\nsclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nTuberculosis\ndiabetic myonecrosis\nSusac syndrome\ncemento-ossifying fibroma\nfolliculotropic and syringotropic CD8 mycosis fungoides\nAutoimmune limbic encephalitis\nBrownTumor\nautoimmune myelofibrosis\nPFAPAsyndrome\nAcute hematogenous osteomyelitis\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nIron refractory iron deficiency anemia\nJunctionalEctopicTachycardia\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\nparaganglioma\nErosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp\nflecainide pneumonitis\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\nMDMA toxicity\nRelapsing polychondritis\nmixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumor\nHypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\nSBP-101 induced retinal toxicity\nClear cell sarcoma\npulmonary cryptococcosis\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nNeuroblastoma\norganized thrombus\nscleredema adultorum of Buschke\nChronicExertionalCompartmentSyndrome\nReactive arthritis\nEarly repolarization syndrome\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis\nFunctional mitral regurgitation\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage\nPFAPAsyndrome\nMarginal keratitis\nYaoSyndrome\nUreteral stone\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nhydrocephalus\nAtypical mastocytoma\nlympho plasmacytoma\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\nSchwannoma\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nAdenosine-sensitive atrial tachycardia\nCancer of unknown primary\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nundifferentiated sarcoma\nGranulocytic sarcoma\nLymphocytic myocarditis\nmicroscopic polyangiitis\nFetus in fetu\nAnaphylaxis\nAdhesive small bowel obstruction\nOsteoma\nossifying fibromyxoid tumor\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\nMycobacterium avium complex\nRecurrentGuillainBarreSyndrome\nFactor VIII and XI deficiency\nancient schwannoma\nAdrenal insufficiency\n",

The lesion demonstrated arterial-phase enhancement, washout in the portal and delayed phases, capsule enhancement, and a signal drop on opposed-phase imaging, indicative of fat content.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nGemcitabine\u2010induced skin necrosis\nDrugInducedLupusErythematosus\nDiabetic myonecrosis\nNonfunctioningPituitaryMacroadenoma\nnon-exertional hyperthermia\nDRESS syndrome\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\nTuberculosis\nFraser syndrome\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nNiclosamide-induced maculopathy\nEBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nCandidiasis\nLung adenocarcinoma\neosinophilic myocarditis\nRhabdomyolysis\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nmyocardial infarction\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nHypersensitivity myocarditis\nCardiacSarcoidosis\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\ngraft rejection\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nneurosyphilis\nMidventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nVanishing bone disease\nMarginal keratitis\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nintralobar pulmonary sequestration\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\nrenal artery aneurysm\nIgG4-related focal retroperitoneal fibrosis\nFat embolism syndrome\nsulfonylurea poisoning\npulmonary bulla\nHistiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nleiomyosarcoma\nmicroscopic polyangiitis\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nCerebralSaltWasting\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\noromandibular limb hypogenesis syndrome\nEmphysematous cystitis\nxanthoma disseminatum\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\nTubulocystic renal cell carcinoma\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nPosterior ischemic optic neuropathy\ntuberculous mediastinal abscess\nintralobar pulmonary sequestration\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nsingle-organ vasculitis\nMedullary thyroid carcinoma\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\nmucous extravasation phenomenon\nEarly repolarization syndrome\nprostatic utricle\nTropheryma whipplei endocarditis\nadult-onset Still disease\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nNonfunctioningPituitaryMacroadenoma\nCardiacSarcoidosis\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nNeuroendocrine carcinoma\nCongenital anterolateral tibial bowing and polydactyly\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nconjunctival cyst\nAorticValveFenestrationRupture\nChronic compartment syndrome\nlichen spinulosus\nPertussis\nlaryngeal tuberculosis\nsuperior orbital fissure syndrome\nlympho plasmacytoma\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nEmphysematous cystitis\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\ncardioinhibitory reflex syncope\nLinearAtrophodermaOfMoulin\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\nvanishing bone disease\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nLuschka duct cyst\nPoncet\u2019s disease\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nMethotrexate pneumonitis\nLung adenocarcinoma\nproximal tibiofibular joint osteoarthritis\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\nGanglioneuroma\nROHHAD\nnecrotizing autoimmune myopathy\nLipoma\n",

There were no caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, neurofibromas, or other cutaneous stigmata of a neurocutaneous disorder. Initial radiographs of the right leg showed anterolateral bowing of the tibia, a medullary cyst, and duplication of the first ray; the fibula appeared straight. At 7 months of age, an MRI of the brain and right lower extremity was performed: the brain was normal; the right tibia showed midshaft cortical thinning with continuous anterior cortex and posterior callus formation without evidence of pseudarthrosis or medullary canal duplication; a supernumerary digit arising from the first cuneiform was noted.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nFemale adnexal tumor of probable Wolffian origin\ntransient brachial plexus block\nNeuroendocrine carcinoma\nshiitake dermatitis\nnecrotizing autoimmune myopathy\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nCOVID-19 myocarditis\nkeratoacanthoma\nOdontogenic cutaneous sinus tract\nossifying fibromyxoid tumor\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nCongenital anterolateral tibial bowing and polydactyly\nMalakoplakia\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nMirizzi syndrome\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus infection\nchemical abscess\nSebaceous carcinoma\nExtralobarPulmonarySequestration\nHirayama disease\nOrbital myositis\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nOrbital myositis\nMoyamoya disease\nAbusive abdominal trauma\nGanglioneuroma\nOrbital myositis\nRecurrent polychondritis\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nHereditary spherocytosis\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nSclerosing meningioma\nIron refractory iron deficiency anemia\nHelsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nnon-exertional hyperthermia\nFactor XIIII deficiency\nsebaceous carcinoma\nthyroid adenocarcinoma\nMetastatic breast carcinoma\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nnodular fasciitis\ncerebral granulomatosis\npulmonary artery vasculitis\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus\u2013positive mucocutaneous ulcer\nWarm autoimmune hemolytic anemia\nuterine artery rupture\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nCervical carcinoma\nAnomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery\narachnoid cyst\nIsolated arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy\nbilateral paramedian thalamic infarction\nOculomotor nerve schwannoma\nCOVID-19 myocarditis\nsuperior orbital fissure syndrome\nhyperinsulinaemic reactive hypoglycemia\nPertussis\nAcinic cell carcinoma\nCervical carcinoma\nleiomyosarcoma\nNeurosyphilis\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\njuvenile granulosa cell tumor\nMalakoplakia\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nCandidiasis\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nFactor VIII and XI deficiency\nacute interstitial nephritis\nsyphilis\nNeuroblastoma\nSerous cystadenoma\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus infection\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\nChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis\nanti-HMGCR myopathy\nConstrictive pericarditis\nMOGHE\nHypereosinophilic syndrome\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\ndiabetic polyradiculopathy\nToxoplasmosis\nGaucher disease type 3C\nruptured hepatic metastases\nbiliary foreign body\nTall cell carcinoma of the breast with reversed polarity\nSerous cystadenoma\neosinophilic myocarditis\ntransient brachial plexus block\ndiabetic myonecrosis\nUveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\ncystic lymphangioma\nOculomotor mononeuropathy\nurticaria multiforme\n",

He denied any current or prior sexual activity, penile discharge, hematuria, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, or cough.  \nInitial urinalysis showed pyuria; no urine culture was performed. Urine nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) was negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. He was diagnosed with acute epididymitis and treated with ceftriaxone and doxycycline, with symptomatic improvement. Six weeks later, he had recurrent pain; scrotal ultrasound again showed epididymitis. Repeat urinalysis (no culture) and gonorrhea/chlamydia NAAT were negative, and he received a 30-day course of ciprofloxacin, which improved the pain but not the swelling.  \nFive months after the initial presentation, he returned with another recurrence. On examination, there was prominent right scrotal swelling and tenderness. Ultrasound demonstrated right epididymitis with possible necrosis, a complex hydrocele, and a focal scrotal abscess. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a complex right scrotal fluid collection, an enlarged heterogeneous prostate, an enlarged juxtaesophageal lymph node, and right apical lung nodular scarring. Although TB was considered in the differential diagnosis, a unilateral orchiectomy was performed because malignancy was also high on the differential given his age.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nOral focal mucinosis\nneurotoxoplasmosis\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nFraser syndrome\nMacrophageActivationSyndrome\nlichen spinulosus\ntransient brachial plexus block\nKaposi sarcoma\nBrownTumor\nToxoplasmosis\nlymphangitis carcinomatosa\nlymphangioma\nParaganglioma\nPulmonary carcinoid\nlymphangitis carcinomatosa\nlymphangioma\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus\u2013positive mucocutaneous ulcer\nAnaplasmosis\npronator teres syndrome\nabdominal migraine\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nHypersensitivity myocarditis\nMyxedema coma\nExtranodal marginal zone lymphoma\nchemical abscess\nPEComa\nNonrheumatic myocarditis\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nMacrophageActivationSyndrome\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nProstate adenocarcinoma\nvanishing bone disease\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\ncentral diabetes insipidus\nNeonatal severe hyperparathyroidism\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\nCancer of unknown primary\nROHHAD\nAbusive abdominal trauma\ngiant cell arteritis\nReactive arthritis\nDiaphragmatic amyloidosis\nSerotonin syndrome\nMcArdle disease\nPseudotail\nMethanol toxicity\ntuberculous mediastinal abscess\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\ntransient brachial plexus block\nVagal paraganglioma\npembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\nMulticentric reticulohistiocytosis\nNesidioblastosis\nSolid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm\nwound botulism\nprimary adrenal insufficiency\nDrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\nExtralobarPulmonarySequestration\nSweet syndrome\nacute renal allograft rejection\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nparaneoplastic hepatitis\npulmonary cryptococcosis\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nprimary retroperitoneal melanoma\nPerifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\nwell-differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nExtralobarPulmonarySequestration\nWilson's disease\nMethanol toxicity\nLaugier-Hunziker syndrome\nDrug-induced lung injury\nIntermittent hydronephrosis\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\nurticaria multiforme\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nacute cerebellitis\nMeropenem-induced thrombocytopenia\nMycobacterium bovis\nHypokalemic paralysis\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nPfeifer-Weber-Christian disease\nabdominal migraine\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nLung adenocarcinoma\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nlichen spinulosus\nKaposi sarcoma\nIntrathoracic ectopic kidney\nFamilial retinal arterial macroaneurysms\nDistal defect of the humerus\nTuberculosis\nLeydig cell tumor of the ovary\nAtypical hemolytic uremic syndrome\n",

She was afebrile, with a heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/70 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed elevated jugular venous pressure and a muffled mechanical closure click. Her medical history was notable for rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve replacement with a 27-mm bileaflet mechanical prosthesis 9 years earlier, a prior episode of prosthetic valve thrombosis treated with tPA 8 years ago, and a reported allergy to porcine products. Home warfarin therapy was chronic, but her INR on admission was subtherapeutic at 1.3.\n\nLaboratory studies showed hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL and brain natriuretic peptide 241 pg/mL. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment changes. Chest radiography showed mild interstitial prominence. CT scan of the chest with contrast demonstrated bilateral moderate pleural effusions and an enlarged pulmonary trunk. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and significant stenosis across the mechanical mitral valve with restricted leaflet motion; the mean mitral gradient was 23 mm Hg at a heart rate of 79 beats per minute. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed an immobile anterior leaflet and restricted posterior leaflet with a mean gradient of 22 mm Hg at 78 beats per minute, and it showed an echo-dense mass on the anterior leaflet. Further CT angiography identified a possible thrombus measuring \u22641.0 cm in greatest dimension attached to the mitral valve.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nmiliary tuberculosis\nmidbrain infarction\nSclerosing meningioma\ncardioinhibitory reflex syncope\nFactorXIIIdeficiency\nLung adenocarcinoma\nSyphilis\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nGiant bullous emphysema\nnecrotizing autoimmune myopathy\nPostoperative inflammation\nWilson's disease\nSMARCA4-DTS\npembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis\nSolitary fibrous tumor\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nMDMA toxicity\nPFAPAsyndrome\nsingle-organ vasculitis\nRetinal neovascularization\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nmicrovascular angina\nSclerosing meningioma\nTuberculousPeritonitis\nHypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nRosai\u2013Dorfman disease\nparaneoplastic leukemoid reaction\nsarcoidosis\nBucillamine-induced pneumonitis\nAbdominal migraine\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nFourth branchial cleft anomaly\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nEagle\u2019s syndrome\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\nparaganglioma\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nIsolated arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy\nHemorrhagic pericardial effusion from blunt chest trauma\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\nSecondary syphilis\nstiff RA syndrome\ntenosynovial giant cell tumor\nNeuroendocrine tumor\nArc-welders\u2019 pneumoconiosis\nAmyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\nAtypical mastocytoma\nGallbladderVolvulus\nTubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome\nFourth branchial cleft anomaly\nToxoplasmosis\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\nConstrictive pericarditis\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nIntussusception\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma\nmyocardial infarction\nsulfonylurea poisoning\nGallbladderVolvulus\nGitelman's syndrome\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nMacroprolactinoma\nPseudotumor deltoideus\nDrug-induced myopathy\nBrucellosis\nuterine leiomyosarcoma\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nGiant bullous emphysema\nhypothyroidism\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nLarge vessel vasculitis\nextrauterine adenomyoma\ntranscatheter valve embolization and migration\npsittacosis\nMycobacterium marinum\nbilateral acute depigmentation of iris\nRecurrent polychondritis\nparaduodenal pancreatitis\nMethemoglobinemia\nintralabyrinthine schwannoma\nossifying fibroma\nNeoplastic parkinsonism\nwell-differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nTransverse myelitis\nLarge vessel vasculitis\nK\u00fcttner's tumor\nOral focal mucinosis\nGerm cell tumor\ndrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nParasitic leiomyoma\nOccupational acro-osteolysis\nWernicke encephalopathy\nEsophageal rupture\nNeuromyelitisOpticaSpectrumDisorder\nOral focal mucinosis\nFat embolism syndrome\nSinusoidal obstruction syndrome\nOrnithineTranscarbamylaseDeficiency\n",

He had type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with oral agents without retinopathy and a 60\u2013pack-year smoking history; there was no family history of sarcoidosis. On examination, cutaneous nodules were noted on his back; the neurologic examination was otherwise unremarkable. Visual field testing showed slight enlargement of the right blind spot. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed optic disc edema with hemorrhages; best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25. There was no evidence of uveitis. MRI of the orbits with contrast demonstrated enhancement of the right optic nerve; brain FLAIR images showed no demyelinating lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed protein 74 mg/dL, 19 mononuclear cells/\u00b5L, glucose 77 mg/dL; there were no oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index, and bacterial, viral, and fungal cultures were negative. Laboratory studies showed an elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level of 34.2 IU/L with normal serum calcium; antinuclear antibody, interleukin-2 receptor, immunoglobulin G4, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, T-spot, and aquaporin-4 antibody tests were negative.

His medications included lifelong clopidogrel, antihypertensives, statin therapy, and insulin.\n\nInitial ECG showed a stable borderline left bundle branch block without ischemic changes. He was admitted for intravenous diuresis. A few days later, he awoke with new right-sided visual disturbance. Vital signs were within normal limits. Neurologically, he had a right homonymous hemianopia; tone, reflexes, cranial nerves, strength, and sensation were otherwise normal. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate with no rub, gallop, or murmur; there were coarse crepitations at the lung bases and bilateral ankle pitting oedema. Abdominal and dermatologic findings were unremarkable.\n\nLaboratory studies showed hemoglobin 102 g/L, white-cell count 15.3\u00d710^9/L, and C-reactive protein 121 mg/L. Five sets of blood cultures were negative. Serologic tests for Coxiella and Bartonella were unremarkable. Coagulation studies, a prothrombotic panel (protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden), and blood film were normal.\n\nDiffusion-weighted brain MRI demonstrated a left occipital lobe infarct at the junction of the posterior and middle cerebral artery territories without hemorrhage or old infarcts. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a 10\u00d77.5 mm heterogeneous mobile echogenicity attached to the bioprosthetic aortic valve with moderate stenosis, severe paravalvular regurgitation, and leaflet degeneration; no valvular abscess was seen.

Ultrasonography and CT revealed a 20-cm hyperdense cystic right adnexal mass with solid components up to the umbilicus. Emergency laparotomy showed torsion of the right ovary; a right salpingo-oophorectomy removed a 1600-g tumor. Histopathology disclosed a benign cystic struma ovarii confirmed by thyroglobulin immunostaining, with lymphocytes and lymphoid follicles among thyroid follicles. Three days after surgery, thyroid function tests showed TSH 0.001 mIU/mL (normal 0.27\u20134.2), free T4 1.32 ng/dL (normal 0.74\u20131.52), and free T3 3.6 pg/mL (normal 2.3\u20134.2). Two months later, she remained asymptomatic but had persistent subclinical hyperthyroidism. Thyroid ultrasound demonstrated a normal-sized gland with mildly heterogeneous echogenicity. Thyroid scintigraphy showed focal uptake in the left lobe with suppression elsewhere, and I-131 uptake was reduced to 16% at 4 hours and 27% at 24 hours.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nMycobacterium bovis\nX-linked hypophosphatemia\nPachydermoperiostosis\nANCA-associated vasculitis\nHepatic bartonellosis\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nadult-onset Still disease\ndiabetic polyradiculopathy\nAreca nut toxicity\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\ngastric-type carcinoma of the endometrium\nDisseminated tuberculosis\ngiant cell arteritis\npulmonary artery vasculitis\nvaricella zoster virus encephalitis\nMethanol toxicity\nDuodromic tachycardia\nOrbital myositis\nFirst bite syndrome\nneurotoxoplasmosis\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nhypothyroidism\nPericardialanisakiasis\nGemcitabine\u2010induced skin necrosis\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis\nNon-pancreatic pseudocyst\nPituitary abscess\nthyrotrophic pituitary hyperplasia\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\nMidventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nMycobacterium marinum\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\ntumor-induced osteomalacia\nmetastatic retinoblastoma\nHypokalemic paralysis\nIdiopathic carotidynia\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\neosinophilic colitis\neosinophilic colitis\nHereditary spherocytosis\nParaganglioma\nMeningioma\nParaganglioma\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nlichen spinulosus\nRosai\u2013Dorfman disease\nnecrotizing autoimmune myopathy\nmucous extravasation phenomenon\nsubpleural pulmonary cysts\nPulmonary embolism\nextrauterine adenomyoma\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nMoyamoya disease\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nextrauterine adenomyoma\nischemic chiasmopathy\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nFetus in fetu\nAcute suppurative thyroiditis\nGadolinium-induced acute pancreatitis\nKapur-Toriello syndrome\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nPulmonary carcinoid\nHistoplasmosis\nPseudotail\nNonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia\nGranulocytic sarcoma\nAdrenal insufficiency\nGallbladderVolvulus\nMycobacterium avium complex\nHashimotos thyroiditis\nMycobacterium bovis\nThyroidFollicularRenalCellCarcinoma\nPseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of the nasal type\nCystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\nMycobacterium marinum\nhydrocephalus\nFamilial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification\nmeningoencephalocele\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\nsebaceous carcinoma\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nparaproteinemic keratopathy\nCystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis\ntorsion of a subserosal uterine leiomyoma\ncardioinhibitory reflex syncope\nMulticentric reticulohistiocytosis\nMenetrier disease\nDRESS syndrome\nCervical carcinoma\nOculomotor mononeuropathy\nmeningoencephalocele\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nNesidioblastosis\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome\n",

His medications included aspirin, clopidogrel, bisoprolol, atorvastatin, and ramipril. Initial examination prior to PCI was unremarkable, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no valvular abnormalities. Coronary angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the distal right coronary artery, which was stented without difficulty, despite a shepherd\u2019s crook configuration of the proximal vessel.\n\nSoon after the procedure, he developed shortness of breath and a short decrescendo early diastolic aortic murmur. NT-pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide was 1784 pg/mL. Chest radiograph was normal, and CT angiography excluded dissection and pulmonary embolism. Repeat TTE showed new moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation (vena contracta 0.6 cm; jet >50% of outflow tract; pressure half-time 340 ms) with an abnormal mobile structure on the aortic valve. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 45% with inferior wall hypokinesis.\n\nTransoesophageal echocardiography identified a 17 mm fine, filamentous mobile lesion attached to the non-coronary cusp, causing a coaptation defect and severe eccentric regurgitant jet. The valve was tricuspid without root dilation. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of infective endocarditis.

He had stable heart failure with preserved ejection fraction for 2 years on bisoprolol, losartan, spironolactone, furosemide, and empagliflozin. Laboratory studies showed total bilirubin increased from 0.9 to 1.7 mg/dL, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase from 32 to 197 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase from 70 to 176 U/L. He developed sialadenitis.  \nElectrocardiography revealed chronic atrial fibrillation. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 50%, biatrial enlargement, a septal bounce, and a 40.1% respiratory variation in left ventricular E-velocity. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated partial pericardial calcifications without aortic wall thickening or hydronephrosis. Right heart catheterization showed equal right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, a dip-and-plateau pattern, and a systolic area index of 2.5.  \nAutoimmune serologies\u2014including anti-nuclear, anti-DNA, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, and anti-RNP-1 antibodies\u2014and C-reactive protein were not elevated. QuantiFERON-TB Gold was negative. His serum IgG4 level was 1168 mg/dL, and a minor salivary gland biopsy showed >10 IgG4-positive cells per high-powered field with an IgG4+/IgG-positive cell ratio of about 40%.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nHyperplastic parathyroid gland seeding\nfibrocartilaginous embolism\nYaoSyndrome\nClear cell sarcoma\nMeasles\nExtralobarPulmonarySequestration\nintralobar pulmonary sequestration\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\nplasmablastic myeloma\nrenal arteriovenous malformation\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nCommon peroneal nerve palsy\nrheumatoid meningitis\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nstiff RA syndrome\nseptic myocardial dysfunction\nHypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis\npseudoaneurysm\nSweet syndrome\nGemcitabine\u2010induced skin necrosis\nIntussusception\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nHemorrhagic pericardial effusion from blunt chest trauma\nlymphocytic myocarditis\nOxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nmalignant catatonia\nPortosystemic shunt\nParaganglioma\nCervical carcinoma\nCerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nClear cell sarcoma\nTakotsubo syndrome\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis\npembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis\nWarburg micro syndrome\nGaucher disease type 3C\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\nWernicke encephalopathy\nEarly repolarization syndrome\nTakayasu arteritis\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nUterine adenosarcoma\nMalignantGranularCellTumor\nSchizophrenia\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nDisseminated histoplasmosis\ndiabetic muscle infarction\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\nsingle-organ vasculitis\nLeiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminate\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\nHyperplastic parathyroid gland seeding\nOsteoma\nParavalvular leakage\nLeft atrial tachycardia\nvildagliptin-induced interstitial pneumonia\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\ntuberculous mediastinal abscess\nossifying fibroma\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nHelsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome\nIgG4-related focal retroperitoneal fibrosis\nMorgellons disease\nTumid lupus erythematosus\nAcquired hemophilia A\nPericardialanisakiasis\nvildagliptin-induced interstitial pneumonia\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease\nIgG4-related disease\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nDuodromic tachycardia\nsulfonylurea poisoning\nvildagliptin-induced interstitial pneumonia\niatrogenic aortic dissection\nWernicke encephalopathy\nparaproteinemic keratopathy\nMOGHE\nhypercupremia\nUterine adenosarcoma\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\njuvenile granulosa cell tumor\nscurvy\nAreca nut toxicity\nCerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\ngeneralized lymphangiomatosis\nTyrosinemia type I\nHepatic bartonellosis\nacquired hemophilia\nMycobacterium marinum\ncutaneous leishmaniasis\nNonurachal adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\npseudoaneurysm\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis\nundifferentiated sarcoma\nGiant cell tumor of the breast\n",

            "reasoning": "The patient has progressive right-sided heart failure symptoms (worsening peripheral edema and pleural effusion despite diuretics) with echocardiographic and hemodynamic findings classic for constrictive pericarditis: septal bounce, marked respiratory variation in LV E-velocity, equalization of RV/LV end-diastolic pressures, dip-and-plateau pattern, and elevated systolic area index. CT shows pericardial calcifications supporting constriction. The marked serum IgG4 elevation (1168 mg/dL) plus sialadenitis and minor salivary gland biopsy showing >10 IgG4+ cells/HPF with ~40% IgG4/IgG ratio strongly indicate IgG4-related disease as the systemic etiology, explaining both salivary involvement and likely IgG4-related pericardial involvement leading to constrictive physiology.

His baseline CD4 count was 5 cells/\u00b5L, rising to 29 cells/\u00b5L by day +21 of ART. On day +21, he noted hypogastric abdominal pain and was treated empirically for urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin, with some improvement. By day +35, the pain recurred, now associated with low-grade fevers and a dry cough; physical examination showed tachypnea (28 breaths/min) and right iliac-fossa tenderness. A complete blood count, chest radiograph, and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable. He was treated for possible atypical pneumonia with doxycycline; his respiratory symptoms improved, but abdominal pain persisted with occasional vomiting. On day +84, a repeat chest radiograph to exclude tuberculosis was unremarkable. His CD4 count had fallen to 14 cells/\u00b5L, and HIV-1 viral load was 22,000 copies/mL despite verified adherence. On day +112, abdominal ultrasound showed an appendicular mass and para-aortic lymphadenopathy; CD4 was 8 cells/\u00b5L and viral load 15,475 copies/mL. He consented to ultrasound-guided biopsy on day +140, and a second ultrasound demonstrated ileal wall thickening (6 mm) with adjacent 1 cm lymph nodes. Two lymph-node biopsy specimens showed no abnormality on histology. By day +168, abdominal pain and vomiting persisted, CD4 was 24 cells/\u00b5L, viral load 23,755 copies/mL, and he was presumed to have ART failure possibly due to malabsorption from thickened gut.

Laboratory studies revealed creatinine 2.55\u2009mg/dL (baseline 1.2), hemoglobin 10.3\u2009g/dL, WBC 7.4\u00d710^3/\u03bcL, BNP 572\u2009pg/mL, and troponin I levels of 0.22\u20130.21\u2009ng/mL. Current free light chains were K-FLC 1379\u2009mg/dL and L-FLC 0.65\u2009mg/dL (K/L ratio 2121). A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. Echocardiography demonstrated a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 64\u2009mmHg, biatrial dilatation, normal ventricular size, and preserved ejection fraction. A ventilation\u2013perfusion scan was negative for acute or chronic pulmonary embolus. After diuresis, right heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 34/9/18\u2009mmHg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10\u2009mmHg. Despite diuresis, he developed worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring continuous noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Pulmonary function tests showed restrictive physiology (FEV1 61%, FVC 58%, FEV1/FVC 104%). A nerve conduction study suggested bilateral phrenic axonal neuropathy.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\ncemento-ossifying fibroma\nHemorrhagic pericardial effusion from blunt chest trauma\nsmall cell lung cancer\nInfective endocarditis\nSclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation\nParaneoplastic cholestasis\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nBirt-Hogg-Dub\u00e8 syndrome\nGastric submucosal arterial collaterals\nmicrovascular angina\nhypothyroidism\nmelanoma\nSMARCA4-DTS\nInvertedLeftAtrialAppendage\nRasmussen's encephalitis\nPrimary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nLower oesophageal stricture\nWernicke encephalopathy\nOculomotor mononeuropathy\nGenital herpes\nNeuroblastoma\nPsychogenicMovementDisorder\nSpindleCellCarcinoma\nSarcoidosis\nDistal renal tubular acidosis\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nReactive arthritis\nMethanol toxicity\ngerminoma\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\nkeratoacanthoma\nintravenous leiomyomatosis\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nPsychogenicMovementDisorder\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\nDiaphragmatic amyloidosis\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\nbilateral basal ganglia infarction\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nuterine artery rupture\nBartonella neuroretinitis\nMalakoplakia\nInfective endocarditis\nautosensitization reaction\nSarcoidosis\ndiabetic polyradiculopathy\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\nChikungunya virus infection\nHemophagocytic syndrome\nLeiomyosarcoma\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nhepatitis-associated aplastic anemia\nHyperglycemic hemichorea\nIgG4-related periaortitis\nFolateDeficientOpticNeuropathy\nScleroderma_renal_crisis\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nMemantine overdose\nBirt-Hogg-Dub\u00e8 syndrome\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults\nsporotrichosis\ndrug-induced interstitial lung disease\nleft atrial thrombus\nExtranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma\nNevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome\nHeart failure\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nTubulocystic renal cell carcinoma\nOrnithineTranscarbamylaseDeficiency\nrenal arteriovenous malformation\ntoxin-induced leukoencephalopathy\nMeasles\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome\nPost-traumatic facial hematoma\nWhipple\u2019s disease\nsclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma\nnodular pulmonary amyloidosis\nAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma\nLeft atrial tachycardia\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nNevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nPEComa\nMorgellons disease\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nNeurofibroma\nType IIIb temporomandibular disorder\nPortosystemic shunt\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nLeft atrial tachycardia\nSchwannoma\nSpontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea\nWhipple\u2019s disease\n",

His father had renal failure and familial Mediterranean fever. Beginning at 6 months, he had recurrent fevers and an absence of sweating. At 8 months, with eruption of his first teeth, he began biting his fingers and toes and sustaining tongue and skin injuries. By age 6, he had learning difficulties, multiple bone fractures from repeated trauma, and by age 9 was reported to have Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome. At age 10, he underwent multiple hip\u2010reduction surgeries for recurrent dislocations. By age 16, he had deformed limbs, a sacral decubitus ulcer, and chronic osteomyelitis of the right elbow, both ankles, and both feet; cultures from right\u2010elbow ulcers grew methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter. At 19 years, he underwent bilateral below-knee amputations. Two months after surgery, he developed ascites. Laboratory evaluation showed uric acid 4.1 mg/dL, creatinine 0.1 mg/dL, serum albumin 1.3 g/dL, ascitic fluid albumin 0.1 g/dL, and a 24-hour urine protein excretion of 6.29 g. Six months later, he developed generalized edema and new-onset diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed multiple erythematous, ulcerating lesions throughout the colon; biopsy demonstrated severe crypt abscesses, goblet cell depletion, and lamina propria inflammation consistent with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease suggestive of Crohn\u2019s disease, and mesalamine was initiated. During the same admission, he had generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures; brain MRI and EEG were normal.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nDRESS syndrome\nRituximab-induced acute lung injury\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nPrimary empty sella syndrome\nBrownTumor\nUveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\nMeningioma\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nCeliac disease\nMyopericarditis\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nBecker muscular dystrophy\nMetastatic melanoma\nNeurofibroma\nstiff RA syndrome\nNeurosyphilis\nvildagliptin-induced interstitial pneumonia\nmicrovascular angina\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome\nGuillain-Barre syndrome\nPleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma\neosinophilic and neutrophilic cellulitis\nBickerstaff brainstem encephalitis\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\nIdiopathic Painful Nervus Intermedius Neuropathy\nGitelman's syndrome\nSerotonin syndrome\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis\nacquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia\nReninoma\nProstheticValveThrombosis\nFusarium proliferatum\nsmall cell lung cancer\nMorgellons disease\nLymphocytic hypophysitis\nCavernous haemangioma\nnodular fasciitis\nmixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumor\nHypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nHDR syndrome\nMicronodular thymic carcinoma with lymphoid hyperplasia\npseudoaneurysm\nErdheim-Chester disease\nOxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nWilson's disease\nSusac syndrome\nExtralobarPulmonarySequestration\nBehcet disease\nMorphea\nancient schwannoma\nepithelioid trophoblastic tumor\nGadolinium-induced acute pancreatitis\nepinephrine toxicity\nKaposi sarcoma\nischemic chiasmopathy\nTakotsubo syndrome\ncold agglutinin disease\nRelationship disappointment stress syndrome\nPericardialanisakiasis\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nNeoplastic parkinsonism\nvitamin D\u2013dependent rickets type II\nTubulocystic renal cell carcinoma\nPostoperative inflammation\nCarcinoma of the axillary tail of Spence\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\nPost-traumatic facial hematoma\nMoyamoya disease\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\neosinophilic and neutrophilic cellulitis\npseudoprogression\ncold agglutinin disease\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nCanalis sinuosus nerve injury\nepiploic appendage band\nIntramyocardial dissecting hematoma\nUterine adenosarcoma\nSerotonin syndrome\nBurkittLymphoma\nMidventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nHypertrophic osteoarthropathy\nHistiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\nHypokalemic paralysis\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nGradenigo syndrome\nChronic compartment syndrome\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nPost-traumatic facial hematoma\nBardet\u2010Biedl syndrome\nHashimotos thyroiditis\nPertussis\nMayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome\nIris stromal proliferation\n",

The occipitofrontal circumference was 54 cm (normal 43\u201345 cm). Brain MRI showed a well-circumscribed, markedly T2-hypointense midline lesion dorsal to the third ventricle with aqueductal obstruction, resulting in dilation of the lateral and third ventricles and a normal fourth ventricle. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a mural type vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation with feeders from both posterior cerebral arteries and the left anterior cerebral artery. The child underwent transarterial embolisation via Onyx injection into the posteromedial choroidal branches of the right posterior cerebral artery, achieving occlusion of the venous sac. On day 3 post-embolisation MRI showed minimal reduction in sac size, mild peripheral rim enhancement, and no internal restricted diffusion. One-month follow-up MRI demonstrated a residual aneurysmal sac with thick peripheral mural enhancement, marked restricted diffusion, and persistent hydrocephalus.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\ncaseous mitral annular calcification\nOrbital myositis\nStrumaOvarii\nAreca nut toxicity\nstiff RA syndrome\nhydrocephalus\nwell-differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nAcute suppurative thyroiditis\nCerebral salt wasting syndrome\nMeropenem-induced thrombocytopenia\nmetastatic retinoblastoma\nlumbosacral plexopathy\nChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis\nneuronal intranuclear inclusion disease\nIntraosseous meningioma\nTakotsubo syndrome\nparaganglioma\nuterine artery rupture\nMethanol toxicity\nGadolinium-induced acute pancreatitis\nBurkitt's lymphoma\nProstate adenocarcinoma\nbiliary foreign body\nNiclosamide-induced maculopathy\nPfeifer-Weber-Christian disease\nFetus in fetu\nKaposi sarcoma\ncold agglutinin disease\nHypersensitivity myocarditis\nIntramuscular hemangioma\nErosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma\nMetformin-associated lactic acidosis\nEsophageal rupture\nPsoriasis\nCiliatedHepaticForegutCyst\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nScleroderma_renal_crisis\nClearCellAdenocarcinoma\nMacroprolactinoma\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nPortosystemic shunt\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nTINU syndrome\nsubpleural pulmonary cysts\nMDMA toxicity\nGiant cell tumor of the breast\nvitamin D\u2013dependent rickets type II\nstiff RA syndrome\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nchemical abscess\nPostoperative inflammation\nLuschka duct cyst\nHypertrophic lichen planus\nthymoma\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\nEosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis\nCavernous hemangioma\nhypercupremia\nTuberculousPeritonitis\nMeningioma\nmalignant pseudothyroiditis\nIdiopathic carotidynia\nvertebral hemangioma\nNoonan syndrome\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus\ngallbladder torsion\nSMART syndrome\nToxoplasmosis\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nPigmentedVillonodularSynovitis\nCavernous hemangioma\nNeurocysticercosis\nExtraosseous peripheral calcifying odontogenic cyst\nbenign metastasizing leiomyoma\nEsophageal rupture\nParasitic leiomyoma\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\nGradenigo syndrome\nHypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis\nMixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma\nHypersensitivity myocarditis\nPericardialanisakiasis\nBucillamine-induced pneumonitis\nNiclosamide-induced maculopathy\nNon-pancreatic pseudocyst\nIntracardiac metastasis\norofacial granulomatosis\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nPsoriasis\nNeuroblastoma\nmiliary tuberculosis\nBecker muscular dystrophy\nhypothyroidism\nOccupational acro-osteolysis\nCOVID toes\nImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome\n",

She reported only difficulty in chewing. On examination, there was gross facial asymmetry with fullness of the cheeks and lower lip and obliteration of the mentolabial sulcus and nasolabial folds. A well-demarcated, hard, lobulated, nontender swelling measured approximately 8\u00d76\u00d75 cm over the left cheek and a diffuse hard, lobulated, nontender swelling extended from the left mandibular ramus to the right mandibular body, obliterating the inferior border. No cervical lymphadenopathy was present.\n\nIntraorally, a diffuse, hard, lobulated swelling extended from the left to the right retromolar regions, with bilateral buccal, labial, and lingual cortical expansion and intact mucosa. A provisional diagnosis of a benign fibro-osseous lesion of the mandible was made, and the differential diagnoses included fibrous dysplasia, ossifying/cementifying fibroma, and central giant cell granuloma (non-aggressive).\n\nLaboratory tests, including complete blood count, serum protein, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels, were within normal limits.\n\nPanoramic radiograph showed a well-defined mixed radiopaque and radiolucent lesion from the left ramus to the right angle of the mandible, measuring about 11\u00d77 cm, with a \u201ccotton-wool\u201d pattern of calcification, concentric growth producing a ball-like outline, and bowing\u2014but no erosion\u2014of the inferior mandibular border. Occlusal radiograph revealed buccal and lingual cortical plate expansion with lingual displacement of teeth. Posterior\u2013anterior mandible view confirmed a mixed radiopaque\u2013radiolucent expansile lesion extending from the left ramus to the right mandibular angle. Axial and 3D CT scans demonstrated a large (11.8\u00d77.0\u00d77.3 cm) expansile lesion of the right and left mandibular bodies and left ramus, with mixed sclerotic and lucent areas and central low-density foci.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\ncruciate paralysis\nbilateral basal ganglia infarction\nAortopulmonary artery fistula\nancient schwannoma\nIntrahepaticCholangiocarcinoma\nCardiac amyloidosis\nxanthoma disseminatum\nMycosis fungoides\nEmphysematous cystitis\nMycobacterium bovis\nPentazocine-induced calcific myofibrosis\nancient schwannoma\nListeria rhombencephalitis\nsolid variant aneurysmal bone cyst\ntenosynovial giant cell tumor\nEarly repolarization syndrome\nQFever\ntenosynovial chondromatosis\nHeart failure\nOxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia\nPFAPAsyndrome\nparaganglioma\nAngiomyofibroblastoma\nappendicitis\nischemic chiasmopathy\nReactive arthritis\nMycobacterium marinum infection\nMycobacterium bovis\nOculofaciocardiodental syndrome\nfalciform ligament necrosis\nMesalazine-induced myocarditis\ncutaneous leishmaniasis\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nStarvation-induced liver enzyme elevation\nSLE myocarditis\nBilateral acute iris transillumination syndrome\nAbdominal migraine\nPostduralPunctureHeadache\nParathyroidAdenoma\nmidbrain infarction\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nPseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\nPrimary generalized epilepsy\nLeydig cell tumor of the ovary\nmultifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia\nEnamel hypoplasia\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nposterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome\nUreteral stone\nIntracardiac metastasis\ncemento-ossifying fibroma\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nAnaplasmosis\nAortopulmonary artery fistula\nNoonan syndrome\nEosinophilic gastritis\nClearCellAdenocarcinoma\nQFever\nopioid-induced catatonia\nvertebral hemangioma\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease\nLipoma\nLimb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\nVismodegib-induced diarrhea\nStreptococcus salivarius pneumonia\nAutoimmuneHemolyticAnemia\ncerebral arterial air embolism\nlipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum\nCancer of unknown primary\nToxicLeukoencephalopathy\nUterine adenosarcoma\nBrucellosis\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\nTIPIC syndrome\nAutoimmune limbic encephalitis\nscurvy\npoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis\nAnaphylaxis\nUreteral stone\nHypertrophic lichen planus\nsolitary fibrous tumor\ncardioinhibitory reflex syncope\ndeep soft tissue leiomyoma\nbilateral lower limb axonal mononeuropathy\nspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda\nClearCellAdenocarcinoma\nCapnocytophaga canimorsus\nGastric submucosal arterial collaterals\nEssential thrombocytosis\nParathyroidAdenoma\nParaneoplastic cholestasis\nleiomyosarcoma\nHypertrophic lichen planus\nTransverse myelitis\ngranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis\nBrucellosis\nhepatic angiomyolipoma\n",

Deep tendon reflexes remained brisk except for absent Achilles reflexes bilaterally; Hoffmann sign was positive. There were no bulbar or respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn 2015, T2-weighted MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrated a slitlike syrinx (central canal dilation) extending from T3 to T9 without Chiari malformation or extramedullary compression; brain and cervical MRI were normal. EMG in 2015 revealed fibrillation potentials, fasciculations, and large\u2010amplitude, long\u2010duration motor\u2013unit potentials in both upper and lower limbs without conduction block. GM-1 and GM-2 antibody titers were negative, and routine blood and CSF studies were normal.

He had undergone a cadaveric renal transplant six years earlier and was maintained on cyclosporine, mycophenolic acid, and prednisone. He wore a prosthetic right lower limb after a below\u2010knee amputation; the eruption began distally on his residual limb and spread proximally. Empiric antifungal cream was ineffective, and topical corticosteroid worsened the lesions. He had traveled to Thailand, Vietnam, and Panama. \n\nOn examination, there were multiple erythematous papules and plaques, some coalescing into an annular pattern on the right thigh. A punch biopsy showed dermal nonnecrotizing tuberculoid granulomas with lymphocytes and rare neutrophils.

On initial examination, he had generalized edema and a grade III\u2013IV holosystolic murmur. Chest radiographs and echocardiography revealed a moderate-to-large patent ductus arteriosus, moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension, and biventricular hypertrophy suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; a bedside PDA ligation was performed. Subsequent evaluation showed Coxsackie B viremia by PCR, and TORCH serologies were negative. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, loop diuretics, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, and dopamine for presumed viral cardiomyopathy. Despite therapy, daily chest radiographs demonstrated progressive nonspecific calcification of the chest soft tissues and the vessels of both arms, and his condition worsened.

Output the diagnosis name EXACTLY as written.\n3) Use ONLY information in the Patient Profile. Do not assume missing facts.\n4) If multiple candidates seem plausible, choose the one with the strongest overall support (most specific matching findings + least contradictions).\n\nOutput:\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no extra text) that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"find evidence from the patient profile to support the diagnosis.\",\n  \"final_diagnosis\": \"the disease name that is most likely to be the final diagnosis\"\n}\n\nPatient Profile:\nA 35-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of mobile teeth in the lower left molar region and progressive difficulty chewing associated with pain and reduced mouth opening. She had hypothyroidism managed with medication; no history of trauma, familial bone disease, or systemic symptoms. On panoramic radiography, an initial patchy osteolysis of the left mandibular condyle was noted. Over 18 months, serial orthopantomograms demonstrated slowly progressive osteolysis extending from the condyle through the angle toward the mandibular body on the left side. Laboratory studies showed hypocalcemia (serum calcium 4.9 mg/dL), low vitamin D (52.14 nmol/L), and low intact parathyroid hormone (14.81 pg/mL). Investigations\u2014including serologies and imaging\u2014were performed to exclude rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, eosinophilic granuloma, and other systemic diseases. A whole-body PET scan revealed no additional lytic lesions. Cone-beam CT with three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed the extent of mandibular bone loss confined to the left hemi-mandible.\n\nCandidate Diseases:\nvanishing bone disease\nintravascular large B-cell lymphoma\nChronicExertionalCompartmentSyndrome\nAcinic cell carcinoma\nFactorXIIIdeficiency\nKaposi sarcoma\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nMefloquine toxicity\nMultilocularThymicCyst\nWilliams\u2013Campbell syndrome\nChronic spontaneous urticaria\nWhipple\u2019s disease\nhypothyroidism\nDrug-induced myopathy\nCongenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis\nscurvy\nbullous systemic lupus erythematosus\nPrimary hepatic lymphoma\nSMARCA4-DTS\nLuschka duct cyst\nKikuchi-Fujimoto disease\nEndolaryngeal epithelial hemorrhage\nurticaria multiforme\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nEssential thrombocytosis\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nbiliary pancreatitis\nFourth branchial cleft anomaly\nAmyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\nneuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus\neosinophilic gastroenteritis\nopioid-induced catatonia\nHeart failure\nPrimary CNS melanoma\nIdiopathic Infantile Arterial Calcification\nneuroendocrine carcinoma\nGranular cell tumor\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nMycobacterium bovis\nPrimary gastric choriocarcinoma\nsmall cell lung cancer\nPseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B\nPulmonary embolism\nHypereosinophilic syndrome\nBurkittLymphoma\nOrnithineTranscarbamylaseDeficiency\nOvarian torsion\nTimolol-induced interstitial lung disease\npsittacosis\ncentral diabetes insipidus\nDiffuseLargeBCellLymphoma\nCaecal adenocarcinoma\nLeydig cell tumor of the ovary\nacute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nSerpentine-like syndrome\nBrownTumor\nextraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nTicagrelor-induced bradycardia\nCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii\nVaricella zoster virus scleritis\nPervasive Refusal Syndrome\nAdenosine-sensitive atrial tachycardia\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nSchnitzler syndrome\nfalciform ligament necrosis\nTubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome\nMefloquine toxicity\nDrug-induced lung injury\nSchnitzler syndrome\nPseudo\u2010thrombotic microangiopathy\nNonspecific interstitial pneumonia\ngallbladder torsion\nSmall B-cell lymphoma\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nasystole\nautosensitization reaction\nChronic compartment syndrome\nPseudothrombotic microangiopathy\nNeurosyphilis\nOrbital myositis\nCeliac disease\nParathyroidAdenoma\nRhabdomyolysis\nplasmablastic myeloma\nSinusoidal obstruction syndrome\nExtraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma\nLucio phenomenon\nThrombocytopenia-associated multiorgan failure\nmembranous glomerulonephritis\ngraft rejection\nautoimmune thyroiditis\nEwing sarcoma\nHypersensitivity myocarditis\nRenalArteryOcclusion\nanisakiasis\nbilateral acute depigmentation of iris\nBilateral adrenal haemorrhage\nLipoma\nundifferentiated sarcoma\n",

            "reasoning": "The patient has slowly progressive, localized osteolysis of the left mandible beginning at the condyle and extending over 18 months, with no other lytic lesions on whole-body PET and extensive workup excluding systemic inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and malignancy (e.g., multiple myeloma, eosinophilic granuloma). Imaging confirms bone loss confined to one hemi-mandible. This pattern of progressive, idiopathic, localized bone resorption with exclusion of other causes is most consistent with vanishing bone disease. Alternative candidates such as BrownTumor or ParathyroidAdenoma are contradicted by hypocalcemia with low PTH rather than hyperparathyroidism, and malignancies/lymphomas are not supported by the negative systemic evaluation and PET scan.",
